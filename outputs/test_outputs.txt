You know what I do is write for kids, and in fact, I probably am the car for kids, more read in the United States.
And I always tell people I don't want to look like a scientist.
I can dress as a farmer, or with leather clothes, and no one has chosen an farmer.
I'm here today to talk about circles and epidemiologists.
And you know that an epiphany usually is something that you fell in somewhere.
You just have to go back to the apple to see it as an epidemic.
That's the painting of a circle.
A friend of mine did that -- Richard Blackberry.
It's the kind of complicated circle which I'm going to talk about.
My circle started in the 1960s in the middle school, in Stanford, Ohio where I was the rare of the class.
They were beaten up to sell every week at the kids, until a teacher saved my life.
She saved my life by allowing me to go into the teacher room.
I did it in secret.
For three years.
And I had to go from the city.
I had a thumb and 85 dollars, and I ended up in San Francisco, California -- found a lover -- and in the '80s, I felt the need to start working in organizations that fought AIDS.
About three or four years ago, in the middle of the night, I got a phone call from that teacher, the God Post he said, "I need to see.
I'm designed that we have never come to know.
You could come to Ohio and please bring that man who I know you've ever found.
And I have to tell you that I have pancreatic cancer, and I would like you to get bored with this please."
Well, the next day we were in Cleveland, OK.
We went to see, we laugh, we cry, and we realized that she needed to be hospital.
We found a place, we got it, and we took it away from his family, because it was necessary.
It's something we knew how to do.
And as the woman I wanted to know as a adults came to meet me, it became a box of centers, and it was put in my hands.
And what happened was that the circle had closed up, it had become a circle -- and that epidemic that I talked to you about was made in itself.
The hope is that death is part of life.
She saved my life, my partner and I save the one.
And you know that that part of life needs everything that the rest of life.
It needs truth and beauty, and I'm very happy that today I was talking a lot about this.
It also needs dignity, it needs dignity, love and pleasure, and it's our work to provide those things.
Thank you.
As an artist, connection is very important for me.
Through my work, I'm trying to express that humans are not separated from nature and that everything is interconnected.
I went for the first time to Antarctica almost 10 years ago, and there I saw my first tapes.
I was amazed.
My heart laughter quickly, I was shown, trying to understand what was in front of me.
The tablets around me were around the water almost 60 meters, and I couldn't even think that it was a core of snow on another snow of snow year after year.
The tablets are born when they get away from the glaciers or break the ice barriers apart.
Every iceberg has its own individual personality.
They have a different way to interact with their environment and their experiences.
Some people refuse to stay and they go up to the end, whereas others can't support them and they fall into a drug of dramatic passion.
It's easy to think, when you see a motor, that they are separated and alone, in large measure as we see sometimes as humans.
But the reality is all the opposite.
As a mother goes down, I am breathing your ancestral atmosphere.
As a mouse melts, it releases rich fresh water in minerals that feed many forms of life.
I'm going to photograph these tables as if it would be about the portraits of my ancestors, knowing that at the moment they exist in that way and won't exist in that way again.
It's not death when they're dead, it's not an end, but a continuation of your way for the cycle of life.
Part of the ideal ice is very young -- it's a couple thousand years old.
And another part of the ice is over 100,000 years old.
The last pictures I would like to show you are from a tablet that I photographed in Keft, Greenland.
It's unlikely to actually get to present a standard top.
Here they are.
You can see the left a little boat.
It's about five meters.
And I'd like you to pay attention to the shape of the tablet and your floating line.
You can see here, it starts to stop, the ship has moved to the other side, and the man is standing there.
This is a Gread show of a primary size.
It's about 120 feet or 40 meters.
This video is in real time.
And so no, the iceberg shows a different side of its personality.
Thank you.
I want you to imagine two couples in 1979, the same day, exactly at the same time, each one of a baby. Okay.
So, two couples every one with a baby.
I don't want you to stop too much in the details of conception, because if you stop thinking about consciousness itself, you won't pay attention to me.
Let's think about that for a moment.
And on this stage, I want you to imagine that, in a case, the chromosome and the sperm is joined to the X chromosome of the egg.
And in the other case, the X chromosome of the sperm is joined by the X chromosome of the egg.
They both lead and start life.
We'll go back to them later.
I tend to take two roles.
In one of my roles I work with the history of the anatomy story.
I am a story for training, and what I study in this case is the way people tackle the anatomy -- that is to say, of human bodies and animals, how they have considered body fluid, the idea of the body, what they've thought about the body.
The other role I performance in my work is an activist, as a patient deforestation, or as I say sometimes, defined impact of people who are medical patients.
In this case, I've worked with people whose physical features challenge social norms.
I've been working on, for example, with similar twins, two people inside the same body.
I've worked with people with another people, people much lower than the average.
And I've been working with a lot of other cases of applied sex -- individuals whose physical typology doesn't fit into male schemes and conventional females.
In general, we can call it interface.
Interesting adopted many ways.
I'm going to put some examples in ways of having a sex that doesn't fit in male or female commons.
For example, there is the case of the individual based on X chemical base whose gene Shei of chromosome -- and he tells the protocols, that we all have in the fatal life, which are technically.
And then, in the federal life, the testicles produce testosterone.
But because this individual lacks of testosterone, the body doesn't react to the same.
It's the syndrome of insulin insights.
So, there are high levels of testosterone but no reaction.
As a result, the body is developed by following a typical female course.
When the baby is born, the baby looks like a child.
It's a little girl. It's raised as a child.
And often, it's not until puberty, when it's growing up and developing the breast, but it doesn't have the menstrual period, when someone realizes something is happening.
After doing it tests you realize that instead of having ovarian and uterus, it actually has testicles and a chromosome.
The important thing to understand is that you can think of a man, but it's actually not.
Women like men, as men, have in the body something called superconductive glands.
They're on the back of the body.
The supermarket glands produce angry, the hormone of male.
Most women like me consider a typical woman -- he doesn't know her communist structure, I think a typical woman most of the women like me are sensitive to the agreemers.
We produce angry antibodies, and we respond to the administrators.
As a result, somebody like me has the brain more exposed to the agreas than the woman who was born with testicles who have the syndrome syndrome to the administrators.
So sex is complicated -- it's not that interfaces are in the middle of the spectrum -- in some way they can be everywhere.
Another example: a few years ago I received a call from a 19-year-old boy born and raised as a saving, had a boredu and sex relationships with her, he took a life as a kid and I had just discovered that he had ovarian and finger.
He had an extreme form of a disease known as a configuration superconduction.
He had the 20th chromosomes, and in the ground the superconductive glands were so active that essentially they created a male hormone environment.
As a result, their genes were maleund, their brain was exposed to the typical mass of marketing.
I was born with a little bit of a child, no one suspected anything.
And it was at the age of 19, when he started having medical problems caused by internal message, when doctors discovered that, in fact, it was women in the inside.
Well, another quick example of a case of interface.
Some people with the 20th chromosomes develop what is known as a subsidies, which is to say, they have a fresh tissue wrapped in technological tissue.
We don't know why that happens.
So, there are a lot of sex.
The reason that kids with this kind of bodies are -- they are general, sizes site, or interface -- they are attached to normal surgeries not to be able to make a better physical health.
In many cases, people are perfectly healthy.
The reason that they are being used to several surgeries is that they're a threat for our social categories.
The system is naturally based on the idea that a particular anatomy brings a particular identity.
We have the idea that being women is to have female identity -- supposedly being black, means to have African anatomy in historic terms.
A terribly simplistic idea.
And when you present a body that shows something quite different, we have problems with capacity.
So we have very romantic ideas in our culture about individual.
Our nation is based on a very romantic concept.
Imagine how amazing it is to have children born like two people inside the body.
The latest recent case is last year with the South African corridor, Cartest Semertraphy, put on a trial of judgment in the International Games in Berlin.
A lot of reporters called to ask me, "What are you going to do to determine whether Caracia Semertria is man or woman?
And I had to explain to the journalists that there is no example.
In fact, we now know that sex is so complicated that we have to admit that nature doesn't draw a foreign line between men and women or men and women and women and women and with women, and we are who we take that line.
So what we have is a situation where the more the science advances, the more we have to admit that these categories -- that we thought were stable anatomical categories that are completely completely correlated with stable identical categories -- are much more difficult than we thought.
And not only in terms of sex.
Also in terms of race, something that turns out a lot more complicated than the terminology allows it.
And as we see, we get into a scanner ground.
So look, for example, the fact that we share at least 95 percent of the DNA with chimpanzees.
What are we going to take away from them in just a few nuclear negatives?
And as we progress in science, we get more and more in an uncomfortable area where we have to recognize that the simplistic categories that we are probably doing are too simplistic.
And we're looking at this in all the fields of human life.
One of them, for example, in our current culture, in the United States today, are the struggles at the beginning and at the end of life.
It's hard to look at a moment from which a body becomes human, and it has different rights to the photos.
There are very busy discussions today -- maybe not in public, but I know within medicine -- and when someone is considered dead.
Our ancestors never had to deal with this question of whether someone was dead.
As a lot of people put a pen in front of the nose, and if he moved they didn't get it.
If I stopped moving it out.
But today, we can, for example, extract vital organs from a body and put them into another body.
And as a result, we need to face the dilemma to really determine somebody's death, and this puts us in a hard situation where we don't have the simple categories of the past.
And you may think that this explosion of categories could beat someone like me.
I have a progression, I'm going to be defending people with unusual bodies, but I have to admit that it puts me nervous.
I will find that these categories are much more unstable.
Stay from the point of view of the concept of democracy.
And to tell you about this tension first, I have to admit that I am an administration of the Foundation parents.
I know they were racist -- I know they were sexy, but they were big.
I mean, they were so brave and audiences and so radical in what they did, that I find each so much of seeing that music curious -- 1776, not for music, which is totally possible.
That's why it happened in 1776 with the founding parents.
The founding parents were, for me, the first activist activists and I explain why.
What they rejected was an anatomical concept and replaced it with another one that was radical and beautiful and kept for 200 years.
And, as everybody remembers -- what they rejected our parents was the idea of the monarchy -- the monarchy was based on a very simplistic concept of the anatomy.
The monarchs of the old world didn't know the DNA, but they had the idea of the right of birth.
They had the concept of blue blood blood.
They were from the idea that it came to the political power for the blood right to the father and then the son, etc.
The French parents rejected that idea and replaced it for a new anatomic concept, and that concept was that all men are created equal.
They leveled the game field and decided that the anatomy that mattered was the anatomy in common and not anatomy differences, that was a very radical thing.
And partly they were doing it because they were part of an illustrated system where two things were being recorded.
The democracy was scared and at the same time, the science.
And it was very clear, if we looked at the history of the Fountain parents, that many were very interested in science and the idea of a natural world.
They were taking away from the supernatural explanations and therefore they rejected the concept of supernatural power transferred by a value of the right of birth.
They were moving towards a natural concept.
And if we look, for example, the Declaration of Independence, talk about nature and the god of nature.
They don't talk about God and the nature of God.
They talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are.
And we were being transferred to the idea of anatomical coincidence.
And by doing so, they were sitting in the foundations of the future Civil Rights movement.
They didn't think about it that way, but they did it for us, and it was great.
And what happened years later?
And women succeeded.
Then he came the success of the Civil Rights movement, with people from the Salibability Trade, who said, "I'm not a woman?
We found men at the Civil Rights movement, saying, "I'm a man."
And again, color people who applied to anatomical coincidence on the academic difference, and again, they succeeded.
We see the same thing with the District movement.
The problem is, of course, that as we look at the copies, we have to start asking why we keep certain divisions.
But attention, I want to keep some anatomical dinosaurs in our culture.
For example, I don't want to give a fish the same rights as a human.
I don't want to say that we had to give us the anatomy of the anatomy.
I don't want to say that the five-year-old were supposed to allow them to have sex relationships or married.
There are some anatomical divisions that for me make sense and I think we should maintain it.
But the challenge is to try to figure out what they are, why keep them and if they make sense.
Well, let's go back to those two things that you see at the beginning of this talk.
We have two beings -- both of them conceived in the middle of 1979, exactly the same day.
So imagine that one of them, Mary was born three months before time: June 1 of June in 1980.
Henry was, on March 1, was born on March 1, 1980.
For the only fact that I had been born three months before Mary is attributed all three months before Henry -- the right to the sexual consent, the right to vote, the right to drink.
Henry has to wait for all of that not because it has a different biological age, but because it was born later.
We found other ways in relation to their rights.
Henry is in virtue of being considered -- if I don't tell you if it's X, in virtue of being considered a man now is the possibility of the mandatory remote that Mary doesn't have to worry about.
Mary on its part, it doesn't have the same rights to marriage that Henry in all states, for example.
Henry can marry all the states with a woman, but Mary can marry a woman just in some states.
So you still feel anatomical categories that in various aspects are problematic and questionable.
And now the question is, what do we do now that science advanced so much in the field of the anatomy that we get to the point of having to admit that a democracy based on anatomy could devote?
I don't want to give up to science, but at the same time sometimes I feel like science is costing us.
Where are we going?
It seems that what happens in our culture is a kind of prosperity attitude -- "Well, we have to take the line somewhere, so we're going to do it."
But a lot of people are stuck in a rare position.
For example, Texas at some point has decided that to marry a man you don't have to have chromosome and that to marry a woman, you have to have chromosome and a woman.
Now, in practice, they don't do the chemical tests to people.
But this is also very strange given the story that I told you at the beginning of the introduction syndrome to the administrators.
If you look at one of the founding fathers of modern democracy, Dr. Martin Luther King in his speech, "Hey Harvard offers a solution.
It says that we should judge people based on the color of their skin, but in the content of their character, going beyond the anatomy.
And I mean, "Yes, the idea looks very good.
But in practice, how do you do?
How do you judge people based on the content of their care?
I want to point out that I'm not sure that I'm not sure we should be based on this to ensure rights to people, because I have to admit that I know from some police police that probably deserve more social services than some humans I know.
I also want to say that perhaps some laboratories that I know can make more informed decisions, smart and mature about their sexual relationships than people in 40 I know.
So how do you put in practice the subject of the contract content?
It's very hard.
And a part of me is wondering what would happen if the character of a person could in the future will be measured with an instrument, maybe with magnetic resonance with it.
Do we really want to get to that point?
I'm not sure where we go.
What I know is that it seems to be very important that the United States is still guiding this awareness of thinking in relation to the subject of democracy.
We've done a good job in defense of democracy, and I think we will do a good job in the future.
We don't live, for example, in a context like Iran in which a man who sits attracted by other men is susceptible to be a killer unless it's willing to be willing to be able to change sex change, in which case it's allowed to live.
We're not in that situation.
I was glad to say that we don't have a context like a surgeon that I talked about a couple of years ago that I had made up to give birth twins and then separate them and to embrace her fame.
But when to the phone, I asked the motivation of the operation -- it was a very risky operation, he told me that in that other country these kids would be very married and therefore had to do it.
What I said, "Well, has the political asylum instead of surgical separation?
The United States offers huge possibilities to people to be who are not forced to change for the state of the state.
So I think we need to be in your head.
Well, to finish up, I mean I've been talking a lot about parents.
And I want to think about what democracy would be, or as it could have been, if we had given more participation to the mothers.
And I want to say something a little bit radical, and that is that I think there can be different ideas that are coming from different anatomic types, particularly if there are people thinking about groups.
For years, since I've been interested in interface, I've also been interested in investigating sexual difference.
And one of the things that has been interested me are the differences between men and women in terms of how to think and operate in the world.
And what we know about the cross-cultural studies is that women, on average, -- not all, but on average, they tend to pay more attention to complex social relationships and to occupy those who are vulnerable within the group.
And if we think about that, we have an interesting situation in our hands.
years ago, when I was in grad school, one of my advances I knew I was interested in feminism -- I was considered feminist -- as I now did a strange plan."
"Tell me what the feminism is.
And I thought, "It's the most silly question I've heard.
Feminism has to do with getting rid of the gender stereotypes, so there's nothing female in the female."
But the more I have thought about his question, the more I found that there is something female in feminist.
That is, there might be something, in average, something different between the female brain and the male that makes us more attention to complex social relationships and willing to help the most vulnerable.
So if the parents were very keen to find a way to protect people in the state of the state, it's possible that, that we have injected more mothers to this concept, perhaps we would have enriched the concept of protection with receptor support.
And maybe that's what we need to do in the future when we bring democracy beyond the anatomy of the anatomy, think less in the individual body, in terms of identity, and think more about relationships.
So as we try to create a more perfect Union, think about what we do for each other.
Thank you.
In 2007, I decided we had to rethink how we think about economic development.
Our new goal should be that when every family thinks where they want to go live and work, have the possibility to choose between at least a handful of different cities that are competing to attract new residents to attract new residents.
Well, right now, we're far from that goal.
There are billions of people in developing countries that don't count with a single city willing to get them.
But the amazing thing about cities is that they value much more than their construction cost.
So we could easily deliver to the world tens -- maybe hundreds of new cities.
Well, this can sound absurd if you've never thought about new cities.
But just replace them for apartment buildings.
Imagine that half the people who want to live in apartments are already owners and the other half still would be missing to achieve it.
They could try to increase the ability by making applications in all existing buildings.
But you know that the problem that you face is that those buildings and the areas that surround them have rules to avoid the molecules and the distractions of construction.
So it would be very hard to do all those applications.
But they could go to a completely new place, building a whole new apartment building, always and when the rules of that place facilitate building rather than putting it out.
So I proposed that governments create new enough reform zones to contain cities and gave them a name, cities under status.
And later I learned that more or less at the same time, Japan and October were thinking about the challenge of reform.
They knew that every year around 75,000 donors would come from their country to go to the United States, and they wanted to ask what they could do to make sure that those people could stay and do those same things in Honduras.
In the summer of 2009 Houders went through a deployed constitutional crisis.
In the next regular elections, Peral Love was taken entirely with a platform where I promise reforms and at the same time reconciliation.
He asked October to be his head of governance.
Meanwhile, I was preparing me to give a talk at TEDTalks.
Through a process of perfection and trial and error and a lot of testing with users, I tried to reduce this complicated concept of cities under its most essential ideas.
The first point was the importance of rules, like those rules that say that you can't go and bother all the current residents of apartments.
We pay a lot of attention to new technologies, but you need both technologies like rules to progress, and they are usually the rules that are moving us forward.
In the fall of 2010, a friend of Guatemala sent October a link with the TEDTalk.
I showed it to Japane.
They called me.
They said, "Let's bring this to the leaders of our country."
So in December we met in Miami in a hotel conference room.
I tried to explain to you this point about how valuable cities are, much more valuable than its monetary cost.
And I used this image that shows the value of the land in a place like New York. Notice that, in some cases, are worth thousands of dollars per square meter.
But it was a pretty abstract discussion and at some point, when there was a pause, October, maybe we could see the video of the TED Talk.
And the talk described in very simple terms that a low city is a place where you start with short land, a status that specifies the rules that will be applied there and an option so that people can choose whether they want to go or not live under those norms.
So the president of Honduras. He called me, and he told me that we had to do this project, this is important, this could be the path for our country forward.
He asked me to go to Technody and talk about four and five of January.
So I presented another talk full of data, which included an image like this, which was trying to explain that to generate a lot of value to a city, this has to be very big.
This is a picture of Dennesse, and the white line is the new airport that was built in Dennesse.
Only this airport covers over 100 square miles.
So I was trying to convince the hormones that to build a new city, you have to start with a site that measures at least 1,000 square miles.
That's over 100,000 acres.
Everybody stripped correctly.
The public faces were very serious and attacked.
The Congress leader came up to the platform and said, "Professor Roman, thank you very much for your talk, but maybe we could see the video of the TED Talk.
I have it here in my computer."
So I sat down, and they showed the TEDTalk.
And this explained the essentials that a new city can offer new choices for people.
There would be an option of a city that you could be in Honey, rather than hundreds of miles away to the north.
And it also includes new options for leaders.
Because the donor government leaders would need help of associated countries, they could benefit from countries associated with that would help us establish and make the rules of the stadium, so that everybody could trust that the status effectively turned out.
We went and we saw a site.
This picture is from there.
It could easily go through a thousand square miles.
And soon after that, the 19 of January, they voted in Congress to increase their constitution and add a constitutional arrangement that allowed these special development regions.
In a country that I just passed through this painful crisis, the voting in Congress to favor of this constitutional increase was 145 to one.
All the parties in society, all of the factors in society.
To include in the constitution, you have to pass twice in Congress.
The 17th of February came over again in another voting in 14 to one.
Immediately after the voting -- 21 to 24 of February, a 30-year-old statement was to the two places in the world that are more interested in engaging in the building of cities.
One of them is South Korea.
This is a picture of a new center of the city that's being built in South Korea, which is bigger than the Boston Center.
Everything you see there was built in four years, after they spent four years getting permission for them.
The other country interested in building cities is Singapore.
In fact, they've already built two cities in China and they're preparing for a third.
And if you think about this practical way, this is the point where we are.
They have a site, and they're already thinking about a site for the second city.
They are preparing a legal system that would allow managers to come, and at the time they would allow us to operate under an external legal system.
A country has already committed to allowing its Supreme Court to be the ultimate large instinct for this new court system.
There are urban planners and cities that are very interested in the project.
They can even get some funding.
But the only thing we know has already solved is that they have a good number of inhabitants.
There are many companies that would like to install in the Americas, especially in a place with a free trade, and there are a lot of people who would like to go to live there.
In the world there are 700 million people who say they would like to immediately change another place.
There's a million a year that comes out of Latin America to go to the United States.
Many of them are parents who have to leave behind their family to go to their family to get a job -- sometimes supermarket mothers who have to earn money for just eating or buying clothes.
Unfortunately, sometimes there are even kids who are trying to meet their parents who haven't seen in some cases, in a decade.
So what does it seem to think about building a new city in Honey?
Or build a dozen of these, or a hundred of these around the world?
What does it seem to think about to insist so that families can choose among various cities that are competing to attract new residents?
This is an idea worth spreading.
And my hearing friends asked me to say, "Thank you TED.
I'm Jessica, and this is my salary.
But before I show you what's inside, I'm going to make a public trust, and it's that, live obsessed with the trials.
I love to find, dress, and more recently, photograph and publish in my blog and they brought adapting and colorful and different for each time.
But I don't buy anything new.
All of my clothes is a second hand of jewelry markets and sensitivity stores.
Oh, thank you.
The second hand stores allow me to reduce the impact of my throat in the environment and my bill.
I get to know interesting people -- usually my money goes to a good cause, and my aspect is unique, and buying it becomes my personal pursuit of testimons.
I mean, what am I going to find today?
Is it from my street?
I'd like the color?
cost less than 20 dollars?
If all the answers are positive, then I feel I've won.
Going back to the theme of my value, I want to tell you what I hit for this exciting week at TED.
I mean, what do you have to do with somebody who has all that clothes?
So I'm going to show you exactly what I brought back.
I've brought seven pairs of clothes, and nothing else.
Indextent room for exactly a week is everything I've put in my value.
I imagined that it would be able to find everything else I want to use after getting here to Palm Springs.
And because they don't know me as the woman walking for TED in inner clothes,  that means I found some things.
And I'd like to show you now the sets for this week.
It doesn't sound interesting?
As I do that, I'm also going to tell you some of the lessons of life that believe it or not, I've learned in this adventure of not using new clothing.
Let's start with Sunday.
I call this a brilliant tour.
You don't have to spend a lot of money to see good.
You can almost always see a phenomenal for less than 50 dollars.
All of the story, including the jacket -- took me 55 -- and it's the most expensive thing I've used in the week.
Lunch," the color is energy.
It's almost physically impossible to be bad humor, when you're looking at a bright red screen.
If you're happy, you're going to attract other happy people.
Mars: The integration is super-completely.
I've spent a lot of time in life trying to be myself.
I just know yourself.
If you surround the right people, you don't just understand you, you will be able to tell you.
Mirrors: Good of the kid you carry in.
Sometimes people tell me that it seems to play the departments, or I remind you at the age of seven years.
I like to smile and say, "Thank you."
Joeebraches: The trust is key.
If you think you see you well with something, it's almost safe you're you.
And if you think you don't see you well with something, it's probably true.
My mother taught me this day after day.
But it wasn't until the 30 years I really understood its meaning.
And I'm going to explain it in a few seconds.
If you think you're a beautiful person in your inner and outside, there's no look at you you can't attract it.
So there's no excuse for anyone from this audience.
We have to be able to achieve everything we want to achieve.
Thank you.
View," an universal truth six words for you: The golden languages go with everything.
And finally, suicide, developing a personal style and only is a great way to tell the world something about you without having to say a word.
I've tried it over and over again when people approached me this week simply by what I was using -- and we had fantastic conversations.
Obviously this is not going to go into my little value.
So before I go home, to Brooklyn, I'm going to donate everything.
Because the lesson I'm trying to learn this week is that you have to leave certain things.
I don't need to be emotionally adapted to these things, because on the back of the corner, there will always be another crazy suit, colorful and brilliant support waiting for me, if there's a little love in my heart and looking for.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
This is a representation of your brain that we can divide in two parts.
The left side, which is the logical part, and the right side, which is the intuitive part.
So if we use a scale to measure each hemisphere, we could design a plane of our brain.
For example, this would be someone who is completely logical.
This would be somebody who is totally intuitive.
So where do you put your brain on this scale?
Some of these extremes, but I think for most of the integrate in this audience, your brain is something like this -- with a big attitude in both hemispheres at the same time.
It's not that they're mutually exclusive.
You can be logical and intuitive.
I consider me one of those people, which just like most other experimental quantum physicists, we need pretty logical to connect these complicated ideas.
But at the same time, we need quite an intuition to make experiments really work.
How do we develop this intuition? Well, we like to play with things.
We put them playing with them, and then we see how they react to us, and then we developed our intuition from that point.
And actually, you do the same thing.
So certain intuition that you can have developed over the years is the one who says that one thing can be just in one place at a time.
I mean, it can sound weird to think that one thing is in two different places at the same time, but you weren't born with this notion -- they developed it.
I remember watching a child playing in a parking bar.
It was a small child, and he didn't do it very well, it always fell down.
But I bet that playing with that parking bar taught him a valuable lesson -- and it's that big things don't allow them to pass them, and they remain in a place.
This is a great conceptual model that you can have from the world, except you're a particle physicist.
It would be a terrible model for a particle physicist, because they don't play with parking bars, they play with these strange little particles.
And when you play with their particles, they discover that they do all kinds of things that are really rare -- like you can go through walls, or you can be in two different places at the same time.
And then they wrote all these observations, and they called it quantum mechanics theory.
At that point the physics was a few years ago, you need quantum mechanics to describe those little particles.
But you didn't need to describe the big objects around us every day.
That didn't fit very well to my intuition. And maybe it's because I don't play very often with particles.
Well, sometimes I play with them, but not much.
And I've never seen them.
I mean, no one saw a particles.
But it didn't fit well to my logical part.
Because if it's all made of little particles, and all the little particles follow the principles of quantum mechanics, so it shouldn't all follow the principles of quantum mechanics?
I don't find the reason why it shouldn't be.
And so I would feel much better if I could somehow demonstrate that a common object also follows quantum mechanics.
That's why a few years ago, I proposed to do exactly that.
And I did.
This is the first object you can see that has been in a support of quantum mechanics.
What we see here is a little computer chip.
And you can try to see the green dot right in the middle.
That's the metal piece I'm going to talk about in a minute.
This is a picture of the object.
And here I'm going to expand it a little bit. It's just in the center.
And then here we make a good approach to the little metal journey.
What we see is a little bit of metal pieces, with a train form and that supported on a platform.
And then I did this almost the same way you would do a computer chip.
I went to a clean room with a new silicon chip, and I put all the big machines for about 100 hours.
For the last material, I had to build my own machine -- to make this hardware with a form of swimming pilot that is underneath the device.
This device has the ability to be in a quantum superconduction, but for that it needs a little bit of help.
Let me make an analogy.
You know how uncomfortable it is to be in an elevator full of people.
I mean, when I'm in an elevator alone, I do all kinds of weird things, but then when other people come up to stop doing those things, because I don't want them to bother you, or actually stay.
Quantum mechanics says that inanimate objects behave in the same way.
The travel companies of inanimate objects are not just people, it's also the light that shines it and the wind that goes on on the side and the heat of the room.
So we knew that if we wanted this piece of metal to behave according to quantum mechanics, we would have to push all the other passengers to it.
And that's what we did.
We put the lights off, then we introduced an vacuum and we extracted all the air, and then we face it to a temperature of less than a degree above absolute zero.
Now, when you're alone in the elevator -- the little piece of metal is free to act as it wants.
So we measured their movements.
We found it moved in very strange ways.
Instead of staying perfectly still, I was vibrating -- and the way it was vibrating was like a breath in this way -- as a force that stretches and contributes.
And when I gave you a smooth push, we were able to make it vibrate, and it doesn't travel at the same time -- something that only happens with quantum mechanics.
So what I'm telling you is something really fantastic.
What does it mean to be a vibrating thing and not glass at the same time?
Let's think about atoms.
In one case, all of the atoms of atoms that make that piece of metal are all the same, and at the same time, those same atoms are moving up and down.
It's just in certain numbers when those are lined up.
In the rest of the time they're disappeared.
It means that every atom is in two different places at the same time, which means that all the metal piece is in two different places.
I think this is great.
Seriously.
It was worth noting in a clean room to do this for all those years, because, look at this, the difference on scale between one atom and that piece of metal is more or less the same as the difference between that piece of metal and you.
So if one atom can be in two different places at the same time, and that piece of metal can be in two different places, why don't you too?
I mean, it's my logical part of it.
So imagine if you were in several places at the same time, how would that be?
How do you activate your consciousness if your body was disappeared in space?
There's another part of the story.
And it's when we heat it, and we turned the lights and looked inside the box, we saw that the metal followed there in a single piece.
And I could get to this new intuition, seemingly all of the objects in the elevator actually only are quantum objects that are just driven in a small space.
You hear a lot about that quantum mechanics claims that everything is interconnected.
Well, that's not so true.
It's more profound than that.
It is that those connections, your connections to all the things around you, literally define who you are, and that's the deep queerness of quantum mechanics.
Thank you.
My name is Ammun.
And 18 months ago, I did another job in Google, until I launched the idea of doing something related to museums and art to my boss that is here and that allowed me to take it.
It took me 18 months.
Many negotiations and stories, I assure you, with 17 very interesting museums of nine countries.
But I'm going to focus on demonstration.
There are a lot of stories of why we did.
I think my own story is just explained in this slide and this is the access.
I grew up in India.
I got a great education -- I didn't complain -- but I didn't have access to many of these museums and artwork.
So when I started traveling and going to museums. I started learning a lot.
And working on Google, I try to make the desire to make it more accessible through technology.
So we formed a team, a big team of people, and we started doing it.
Better than it shows the demo to then explain to you a couple of interesting things that we have led from their launch.
So, we just go to Kocover.
Look around all the museums that there is.
There's the Germany gallery -- MoMA, Emilogram, Ritzler, the Van Gogo.
In fact, I'm going to go into one of my favorite favorite, the Metropolitan, the New York art museum, in New York City.
There are two ways to do it -- very simple.
We click and child, we're already inside the museum.
No matter where they are, Bombay, or Mexico, that doesn't really matter.
You move around and get fun.
Do you want to navigate by the museum?
We opened up the top of the top, and with a single click, we jump in.
They're inside, they want to go at the end of the hall.
Keep forward. They fly them."
Take it.
Thank you, but I haven't reached the best.
Now I'm in front of one of my favorite paintings -- "The Shopping British Pieces in Metropolitan.
I see the sign.
If the museum shows us the image, we click there.
See, this is one of the images.
Here's all the metal information.
For those of you who are really interested in art, you can click there, but I'm going to click here right now.
And this is one of the images that we've captured in what we call the golf technology.
So this image, for example, contains -- I think, about 10,000 million pixels of them.
And there are many people who ask me, "What do you get with 10,000 million pieces?
So I'm going to show you what you really do with 10,000 million pieces.
It can be done around very simple.
You see things fun that are happening.
I love this guy, his expression has no price.
But if you really wanted to depend.
So I started playing, and I found something that happened there.
And I said, "A moment, this looks interesting.
I came in, and I discovered that kids were actually playing something.
I did a little bit of research, I talked to some people at the Metropolitan -- and I actually discovered that this is a game called "Biffer: which is to hit a time with a stick of the Mars Mars.
And apparently it was very popular.
I don't know why they did, but I've learned something about it.
And now we're going to go even deeper and see that you can actually get to the cracks.
Now just to give you a little bit of perspective, I'm going to go through the image, so you'll see really what there is.
This is where we were, and this is the painting.
The best thing is coming, a second.
So now we're going to quickly jump to the MoMA in New York.
Here's another one of my favorite, "The night Star."
The example I showed you was to find detail.
But what if you want to see the particular party?
And if you want to see how Van Gogh actually created this teacher actually?
It goes up, and it really does it.
I go to one of my favorite parts in this room, and I'm really going to get to the cracks.
This is "the night startling: I think I had never seen it before.
I'm going to show you another one of my favorite functions.
There are many things more here, but I don't have time to show you.
This is the really cool part. It's called "Collaborators."
All of you, absolutely everyone, doesn't matter whether it's rich or poor, or if you have a manipulation, that gives you the same.
You can online to create your own museum, create your own collection from all these images.
It's very simple, we go in, I created this function that I call "The Power of the So So So So So I could just do a button around.
It's about "The Americans in the National Gallery in London.
You can love things, send it to your friends and keep a conversation about what you feel when you look at these masterpieces in the strength.
So in conclusion, I think for me, the main thing is that all amazing things don't really come from Google.
No, in my opinion, they even don't come from museums.
Maybe I shouldn't say this.
Actually, they come from those artists.
And that's been my humble experience with this.
I mean, I hope that in this digital medium makes your artwork justice.
And the big question that I'm doing today is, "Do you do this to repeat the experience of going to a museum?
And the answer is no.
It's to make the experience.
And that's it. Thank you.
Thank you.
Good evening everybody.
I have something to show you.
Think of it it's a shell, a flying shell.
In our lab, we call it sensitive design.
I'm going to tell you a little bit about this.
If you look at this picture -- I'm from Italian origin, all the kids in Italy grow up with this picture on the wall of his bedroom. But the reason I show you this is that something really interesting happened in formula careers one in the last two decades.
There was some time ago, if you wanted to win a formula from formula one, he took a budget and put it into a good pilot and a good car.
And if the car and the pilot were good enough, you won the race.
This is what it is, in engineering, called control system in real time.
It's essentially a system that has two components -- a sensor and an accident.
The interesting thing today is that the real-time control systems are starting to enter our lives.
Our cities, in the last few years, have been covered from networks and electronics in the last few years.
They're getting computers back into the air.
And, as such, they're starting to respond differently, and they can be detected and activated.
It's a big thing.
As I noticed that I wanted to mention that cities are only two percent of the planet's cortex but represent 50 percent of the world's population.
75 percent of energy consumption -- up to 80 percent of the CO2 emissions.
If we could do something with cities, it would be a big thing.
Beyond cities, all these decisions and activists are entering our everyday objects.
This is from an exhibition of Paul Antel for late top of the MoMA during the summer.
It's called "Tale Tomorrow."
Well, our objects, the environment, start to talk to us.
In a way, it's like almost all the existing atoms become sensors and activists.
And that's completely changing the interaction that as humans have with the outside environment.
In a sense, it's almost like the old dream of Michael Angeles.
You know, when Michelangelo angel sculpted the Moses, he said that at the end he took the hammer, and he threw it up to the Moses -- you know, you can still see a little mile below -- and he said screaming, "Part of the park? Why don't you talk about?
Well, today, for the first time, our environment starts to talk to us.
And I'm going to show you just a few examples, insisting in the idea of capturing the environment and action something.
Let's start with detail.
The first project I wanted to share with you is actually one of the first projects in our lab.
This was four and a half years ago in Italy.
It was a summer hopefully in 2006.
It was the year that Italy won the World Cup, the year.
Maybe some of you remember it, played Italy and France, and at the end of the Zip it gave the head.
And anyway, in the end won Italy.
Now let's see what happened that day looking at activity happening on the network.
So here we see the city.
You see the College in the middle and the Terrange River.
It's the morning, before the game.
The time line is at the top.
At the early evening there are people here and there doing calls moving around.
The party starts -- silence.
France. Gulf of Italy.
Engineering, people do a quick call and goes to the bathroom.
Second time. End of regular time.
First additional time, second.
Zipcal, and at a moment, your head.
Gang Italy, yes.
That night they all went to celebrate the center.
There you see the big peak.
The next day they all went to the center at the center of the winning team and the prime minister of the time.
And then everybody goes down.
You see the image of the place called Circle Master where, from the romance time, people are going to celebrate -- it's a big party, you can see the peak at the end of the day.
This is just an example of how you can measure the pulse of the city in a way that we wouldn't have done just a few years ago.
Another quick example of detection is not people, but of things we use and consume them.
Today we know everything about the process of our objects.
This is a map that shows all the chips that make a Mac -- how they embrace.
But we know very little about where things go.
So in this project, we developed some small tags, to track the trash in its way through the system.
We started with some volunteers that helped us in Seattle a little more than a year ago, to tag what they were throwing out, different kinds of things, as you can see, things that they anyway.
Then we put a little chip, a label on the trash and then we started tracking it.
These are the results there.
From Seattle.
after a week.
With this information, we realized that there are lots of things in the system.
We can do the same thing with a lot less energy.
These are data that they didn't exist.
They're happening complicated things, and there's a lot of unnecessary transportation.
But the other thing that we think is that if we look at every day that the cup that the cup that we shine doesn't disappear, it's still somewhere on the planet.
That if the plastic bottle that we shine one day still goes there.
And if we show that to people, then we can promote some change.
That was the reason for the project.
My colleague at MIT, Asia Bible, could tell you a lot more about detection and many other great things that we can do with that, but I wanted to go to the second part that we mentioned at the beginning, which is to act on the environment.
And the first project is something we did a couple years ago.
It all started with a question of the mayor of the city, which came and told us that Spain and South Europe have a beautiful tradition of water use in public spaces, in architecture.
And the question was, how can technology, the new technology, to join that?
And one of the ideas that we developed at MIT, in a workshop -- it was imagine that they have a coffee and valves -- soldiers and soldiers that open up and shut up.
It creates like a water cut, with water pixels with water.
If you walk the pixels you can write in them, show patterns, images, text.
And when we zoom in, the curtain will open up so that we can happen, as you see in the image.
We presented this to the Black Mayor of the Black.
He liked it a lot.
And I developed a commission to design the building to the entrance of the Experiment.
We call it Digital Water Play.
The whole building is made of water.
There are no doors or windows or windows -- but when you approach it to open up so you can happen.
The roof is also covered by water.
And if there's a little bit of wind, if you want to minimize the spaces, you go down the roof.
Or you can close the building and all the architecture disappears, like this case.
Those days, there will always be somebody, in the winter, when you go down the roof, somebody who was there and said, "Let's demonstrate the building."
No, it's not that they have demonstrated it, but when you go down almost all the architecture disappears.
Here it is working.
You see the people who are introduced by what happens inside.
And here I am trying to not be able to get to test the sensors that open water.
I think I should tell you what happened one night when all the sensors stopped working.
That night was actually even more fun.
All the children in Zapan came to the building, because the way to interact had changed a little bit.
It was no longer a building that was open to let me happen, but a building that kept making cut and water holes and you had to jump out to not be moving.
(Audience noises) And for us that was very interesting because as architects, engineers, designers, we always think about the use of people to give our designs to us.
But then reality is always unpredictable.
And that's the beauty of doing things to interact, that people use.
This is a picture of the building with the physical phones, the water pixels and of projects about them.
And this is what led us to thinking about the next project I'm going to show you.
Imagine that those pixels could start flying.
Imagine you could have little helicopters in the air, and that each one had a little pixel change that changes color as if it was a cloud that's moving in space.
This is the video.
Imagine a helicopter, like the one we saw before, which moves with others in synchronize.
We could form this cloud.
A kind of flexible screen like this with normal configuration in two dimensions.
Or normal, but in three dimensions, where what changes is light, not the position of the pieces.
You can play with a different guy.
Imagine that the screen appears in different scales and size, in different kinds of resolution.
And then all of that could be a cloud of phones in 3D, which you can zoom in, and go through, and see from very different angles.
This is the true collapsed Florida, going down to form a Village, like before.
When you turn the light, you see this. The same thing we saw before.
Imagine each of them controlled by one person.
We can have each pixel with an input that comes from people, the movement of people, etc., etc.
I want to show you something for the first time.
We've been working with Robert Boyle -- one of the best ballet dancers today, the Metropolitan star in New York City and the Scall School -- to capture their 3D movements and use them as input for the Florida.
Here we can see Robert dancing.
On the left you see the pieces, it captured it in different resolution.
It's both 3D digitization as a movement capture.
It can rebuild all the movement.
You can travel all the way.
And once we have the pixels we can play with them, with color and movement, with gravity and rotation.
We want to use this as a possible entry for the Florida.
I wanted to show you the last project we're working on.
It's something for the London Olympics.
It's called the cloud.
And the idea is, imagine again, that we could engage people to do something and change our environment -- as a cloud of clouds -- like the grain crash, but with a cloud.
Imagine that we could make everybody drop a little bit for a string.
And I think the remarkable thing that has happened over the last two years is that, in the last two decades, we went from the physical world to the digital world.
We've digitized everything, as knowledge, and it's accessible to the Internet.
Today, for the first time -- and the Obama campaign showed you, we can move from the digital world, the self-organizing power of the networks, to the physical world.
In our case, this may we want to use it to design and make a symbol.
That means something built in a city.
But tomorrow can be to address the challenges of today: think about climate change or CO2 emissions -- how do you go from the digital world to the physical world?
The idea is that we can make people involved in doing this together, collectively.
The cloud is a cloud, again, made of pixels in the same way that the real cloud is a cloud of particles.
And those particles are water, while in our cloud are partners.
It's a physical structure in London, but it covered pieces.
You can move inside, have different experiences.
You can see from below, to be able to share the main moments of the 2012 Olympics.
So it's both a physical cloud of heaven as something you can rise, like a new summit of London.
You can get there.
As if it was a new digital face at night, but most importantly is that it will be a new experience for anyone who goes to the top.
Thank you.
Would you like to be better than they are?
Suppose I told you that, with just a few changes in their genes, they could improve memory -- for more precise, more accurate and faster.
Or maybe you would like to be in a better way, be stronger than having more resistance.
Would you like to be more attractive and safe of themselves.
How about to live more with good health?
Or maybe they're from those people who always wanted to be more creative.
What would you like to do?
What would you like, if you could choose something?
(Click of the Audience: creativity. Creativity creativity.
How many people choose creativity?
Raise your hand. Let me see.
Something is probably due to the number of creative people present.
That's very good.
How many would choose memory?
A few more.
And the physical state.
A little less.
How about longevity?
Ah, most of it, that makes me feel very well as a doctor.
If you could have some of this the world would be very different.
Is it just imagination?
Or is it maybe possible?
Evolution has been a permanent subject here at TED Conference but today I want to give you a look at a doctor on the subject.
The great generation of the 20th century, T.B. Doctor, who also was in the Russian Orlean Church, wrote a trial called "No in biology makes sense of the light of Evolution."
But if you effectively accept biological evolution to consider this, it's just about the past, or the future?
Does it mean others or us?
This is another look at the tree of life.
The human part of this branch -- well at an end, it is, of course, the one that interests us.
We stopped a common ancestry with modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago.
In the interface there has been maybe 20 or 25 different species of humiliations.
Some have gone back.
We've been here about 130 years old.
It might seem that we're very far from other parts of this tree of life, but actually, most of the basic machinery of our cells is more or less the same.
Do you realize that we can leverage and control the machinery of a common bacteria to produce the protein of human insulin that is used to treat diabetes?
This is not like human insulin -- but it's the same protein, chemically indistinguishable -- that comes out of the pancreas of the pancreas of the pancreas of the pancreas of the pancreas that comes out of the pancreas of the pancreas of the pancreas of the pancreas of the pancreas that comes out of it.
And talking about bacteria -- you realize that we are all in the most bacteria gut than the cells that we have in the rest of the body?
Maybe 10 times more.
I mean, think -- when Antonio Damn would give you the shoes of the show -- think of bacteria ...
The gut is a wonderfully hospitable environment for those bacteria.
It's warm, dark, fashion, it's very accelerated.
And we're going to provide all the nutrients that you can want without effort from their part.
It's really a quick pathway for bacteria with the occasional disruption of some force to the output.
But in fact, we are a wonderful environment for those bacteria in the same way that they are essential to our life.
They help digest essential nutrients, and protect us from certain diseases.
But what would the future?
Are we in a kind of evolutionary balance as a species?
Or are you destined to become something different, something perhaps better adapted to the environment?
In this vast symphony of the universe, life on Earth is like a brief cosmos, the animal kingdom, as one and only companies -- and human life, a little note of grace.
That was us.
And it was also the entrepreneur part of this talk, so I hope you've enjoyed it.
When I went to college, I had my first class of biology.
I was fascinated by the elegance and beauty of biology.
I fell in love with the power of evolution, and I realized something fundamental -- most of the existence of life, in the energy organisms, every cell is distinctly divided and all the genetic energy in that cell is transmitted to the two daughters of the cell.
But when multicellular organisms show things start to change.
It enters sexual reproduction.
And something very important, with the emergence of sexual reproduction that happens the genome, the rest of the body becomes predictable.
In fact, you could say that the investment of death death comes into evolution at the same time of sexual reproduction.
I have to confess you that when I was a college student thought to myself, well, sex sex, sex, death for sex -- looked pretty reasonable at that time, but with every year I was going on, it had more doubt.
I got to understand the feelings of George Burnets, which still acted in Vegas.
And one night someone hits your hotel door.
He opens the door.
In front of it, he finds a magnificent landscape of clothes.
He looks at it and says, "Come for a sex soup."
"Okay, he says, "Okay, George says, "I choose the soup."
I realized, as a doctor, who was working for a different goal to the goal of evolution, not necessarily contradictor, just different.
I was trying to preserve the body.
He wanted us to keep us healthy.
I wanted to recover health in disease.
I wanted to live more and healthier.
Evolution consists of passing the genome to the next generation -- adapting and surviving generation after generation.
From an evolutionary point of view, you and I are as record rockets designed to send the genetic burden to the next orbit level, and then let us fall on the sea.
I think we all understand the feeling of Woody Allen when he said, "I don't want to achieve the immortality through my work.
I want to make it not dead."
Evolution doesn't necessarily favors longevity.
It doesn't necessarily favor the largest or the strongest or even the most intelligent one.
Evolution favors the best creatures to their environment.
That's the only test of survival and success.
At the bottom of the ocean, the teachers that can survive the heat of the formulas that would produce -- if there were fish there, fish cocained to the vacuum, yet they've managed to make that a medical environment.
So what does this mean when we look at what's happening in evolution, and if we go back to thinking about the place of humans in evolution, and in particular, if we look forward to the next phase -- I would say there are a lot of possibilities.
The first one is we don't evolve.
We've reached a kind of balance.
And the underlying reasoning would be that through medicine, first of all, we've been able to preserve a lot of genes that otherwise would have been discarded and removed from the population.
And secondly, as a species, we've turned out our environment to adapt to us as well as we adapt to it.
And by the way, we migrated, and we get so excited that it is no longer possible to have the evolution required for evolution.
A second possibility is that you produce an evolution of the traditional type, natural type, imposed by the forces of nature.
And the argument here would be: the gears of evolution are reviewing application, but they're interesting.
And in terms of isolation, when as a species we collect distant planets are going to exist, and environmental changes that can produce evolution in a natural way.
But there is a third possibility -- an attractive possibility.
I call it news, new evolution, which is not simply natural, but guided and chosen by us as individuals in the decisions that we will make.
Now, how could this happen?
How could we get to do this?
We first consider the reality that many people today, in some cultures, are making decisions about their offspring.
In some cultures, they're choosing to have more varieties than women.
It's not necessarily good for society, but it's what you choose at the individual and family level.
They also think that if it could be possible to be able to choose not just the sex of your offspring.
What if we could do genetic changes to remove diabetes or Alzheimer's risk or reduce the risk of cancer or eliminate applause?
Don't you want to make those changes in their genes.
If you look at the future that kind of changes will become more and more possible.
The Human Genome Project started in 1990 and it was 13 years.
It cost 27 billion dollars.
The next year we had finished, in 2004, I could do the same work for 20 million dollars in three or four months.
Today, you can get a complete sequence of the three billion base pairs from the human genome at a cost near the 20,000 and in a week.
It's not going to be a lot for you to actually make the human genome for 100,000 and be more and more to the reach of all.
They come those changes.
The same technology that has produced human insulin in bacteria can make viruses that are not only going to protect us from themselves, but they're going to induce immune against other viruses.
Believe or there is no experimental trial in course with the vaccine against the influence of the crime plant.
Can you imagine something good that comes out of the table?
That's reality today and in the future is going to be more and more possible.
Imagine just another two little changes.
Can you change the cells from their bodies, but if you could change the cells from your dependency?
What if they could change the sperm and the volumes, or change the ultimate second conclusion, and give your children a better chance of a healthier life, eliminating diabetes, eliminating humiliation, reducing the risk of cancer?
Who doesn't want the healthier children?
And then that same analytical technology, that same engine of science that can produce changes to prevent diseases will also enable us to adopt surgery -- a better memory.
Why not have the ingenuity of a Ken Jones on everything if you could increase it with the next generation of the Watson machine.
Why don't you have a faster pollution muscle that allows us to run faster and more distance?
Why not live more time?
This is going to be irresponsible.
And when we're in conditions of passing this to the next generation and we could adopt the attributes that we wanted to have converted the evolution of before the news.
We're going to take a process that normally could take 100,000 years and we can compress it to 1,000 years, and maybe it happened within the next 100 years.
These are choices that their grandchildren, or the grandchildren of their grandchildren, are going to have to have them.
Are we going to use these choices in a better society, more successful, more considered?
Or, are we going to selectively choose different attributes that we want for some of us, but not for others?
Are we going to build a society that is more boring and more uniform or more robotic and more vertebrate?
This is the kind of question we're going to have to face.
And the deepest thing about all: are we going to be able to develop wisdom and to inherit the wisdom required to make these decisions that?
For good or worse, and before what I could think, these options are going to depend on us.
Thank you.
Imagine a big explosion when you're at 900 feet high.
Imagine a plane full of smoke.
Imagine a motor making clear, clean, clean.
Of course, clearly, clearly, clean. It sounds scary.
Well, I had a unique seat that day. I was sitting in the 18.
It was the only one I could talk to the flight assistants.
So I immediately looked at them, and they said, "There's no problem. We probably hit some birds.
The pilot had already seen the plane, and we weren't so far.
You could see Manhattan.
Two minutes later, three things happened at the same time.
The pilot runs the plane with the Hudson River.
That's usually not the route.
I put the motors off.
Imagine being in a plane and without noise.
And then he said three words.
The top three words I've ever heard.
He said, "Get ready for the impact."
I didn't have to talk more with the flight assistant.
I could see it in his eyes.
The life was finished.
I want to share with you three things I learned about myself that day.
I learned that everything changes in a second.
We have this list of things to do before we die, these things that we want to do in life, and I thought about all the people I wanted to come and I didn't do, all the fences I wanted to repair -- all the experiences I wanted to have and never had.
While I thought about that later on, I came up with a sentence, which is, "Collecting bad videos."
Because if the wine is ready and the person is there, I'm going to open it.
I don't want to spend anything in life.
And that urgency, that purpose, has really changed my life.
The second thing I learned that day -- and this is as we went through the George Washington Bridge -- which was not for a lot -- I thought about it, Wow, I really feel a great ride.
I've lived a good life.
In my humanity and my mistakes I've tried to improve all I did.
But in my humanity also give rise to my ego.
And I read the time that I wasted in things that didn't matter with people who matter.
And I thought about my relationship with my wife, with my friends, with people.
And then, as a measure in that, I decided to remove the negative energy of my life.
It's not perfect, but it's much better.
In two years, I haven't had a fight with my wife.
It feels like wonder.
I don't try to get right. I chose to be happy.
The third thing I learned -- and this is like your mental clock is going to go, 15, 14, 13.
You see the water approach.
I'm saying, "Please fly."
I don't want this to break up in 20 pieces as you see in those documents.
And as we went down, I had the feeling of word, what I would die is not fear.
It's almost like we've been preparing for it all our life.
But it was very sad.
I didn't want to go. I love my life.
And that sadness was embedded in a single thought, which is, I just wish one thing.
I wish I could see my kids grow up.
A month later, I was in a performance of my daughter -- first grade, not a lot of artistic talent -- still --    I scream, cried.
And for me, that was all the reason to be the world.
At that point, I understood when we connect those two points that the only thing that matters in my life is to be a great father.
Of course, the only goal I have in life is to be a good father.
I became a miracle of not dying that day.
And I got another gift, which was the possibility of looking at the future and going back and living in another way.
You guys who are flying today, the challenge to imagine that the same thing happens in your plane -- and please, it's not like this, but imagine -- and how do you change?
What they would do, they still expect to do because they think they're going to live forever.
How do you change their relationships and the negative energy in them?
And most importantly, are the best fathers you can do?
Thank you.
I've clearly been blessed in life with many amazing projects.
But the most cool one I worked on was for this guy.
The guy is called TEDTalk.
TEDTalk was one of the most important graffiti graffiti in the '80s.
One day he came home after he ran and said, "Dad, I feel an ant in the legs.
And that was the beginning of ALS.
Today TEDTalks has a total paralysis today.
It can only use your eyes.
His work influenced me.
I have a design company and animation, so obviously graffiti is something that we admire and respect in the art world.
So we decided that we were going to pay Tony and TEDxUSC.
So I went and met her brother and her father and I said, "We're going to give you this money.
What are you going to do with it?
And his brother said, "I just want to be able to talk to Tony again.
I just want to be able to communicate with him, and he's able to communicate with me."
And I said, "A second, it's not that I have seen Stephen Hawking -- it's not that all of the parallel people can communicate through those devices?
And he said, "No, unless you get somebody who is important and you have a very good one you can't actually do it.
These devices are not affordable for people."
And I said, "Well, how do they communicate then?
Anyone to see the movie "The Spanish and the Mark?
They communicate in that way -- they go through the finger.
I said, "That's author. How can it be?
So I came up with the only desire to deliver a check, and instead of that signed a check that didn't have the least idea of how I was going to cover it.
I was engaged with her brother and his father there at the very moment -- very well, this is the treatment: Tony is going to talk about, we're going to build a machine, and we're going to find a way to come back and do his art again.
Because it's ridiculous that someone who has so much in their inside cannot be able to communicate.
So I talked about a couple of months later.
I met these guys called GGA Record Lab," who have a technology that allows them to project a light on any surface, and then with a laser pollution, they draw about that and record the negative space.
So they go around doing art facilities like this.
All the things that come out, they say, are part of a cycle of life.
They first start with sexual organs, then with bad words, after the attacks to Bush and at the end, people start making art.
But there was always a cycle of life in his presentation.
And so it started the journey.
And about two years later, about a year later, after a lot of organization and a lot of moving things on one side to another had made a couple of things.
One, we played the insurance companies and we got a machine so that TEDTalk could communicate, a machine like Stephen Hawking.
Which was great.
And seriously, it's the most fun -- I call it Nobel, because when I talk to the guy, you get an email of him, and you say, "I don't deserve it. This guy is fantastic."
The other thing we did was bring seven programmers around the world literally from all the corner of the planet -- to our home.
My wife, the children and I, we moved to garage back and these hackers and programmers and conservation and advances took control of the house.
Many of our friends thought we were doing something completely stupid and when we came back and removed the frames of the walls and instead there would be graffiti in place.
But for two weeks we program -- we went to the sea father of Venice, my son was part of, my dog too, and we created this.
It's called Einstein Spinal And you can see the description of it.
These are a couple of cheap sun glasses that we bought on the Mars Barcellas farmer, some of the copper wire and Homo Depression and Radio Shake.
We take a PMS camera, we open it, we put it on a LED light, and now there is a device that is free -- it builds yourself yourself, we publish the free code, the software goes down free.
And we created a device that has no limitation at all.
There's no insurance company that says, "No."
There's no hospital that can say "No."
Any person with paralysis today has access to draw and communicate using their eyes.
Thank you.
Thank you very much for you. That was awesome.
So at the end of the two weeks, we came back to the TED room.
I love this picture, because this is another person's room, and that's his room.
There was all this burning and advertising during the big opening.
And after more than a year of planning -- two weeks of programming, intense sessions all night, Tony came back to draw for the first time in seven years.
And this is a wonderful picture because this is the support system of your life and it's looking through the support system of your life.
We ran the bed so I could see.
And we put a project on a wall of the hospital outside of the hospital.
And he came back to draw for the first time in front of her family and friends -- and you would imagine what was the feeling in the parking stage.
The funny thing was that we had to break in the parking way, so we feel like we were reading graffiti as well.
At the end of this, he sent us an email and this was what he said, "This was the first time I drew in seven years.
I felt like I had been under the water, and someone finally came to rescue me, and I would get out of there so I could breathe.
Isn't it amazing?
In a way, that's our war scream.
That's what keeps us in motion, developing it.
And we have a long way to go through this.
It's a cool device, but it's the equivalent of a magic screen.
Someone with this artistic potential deserve a lot more.
So we're trying to figure out how to improve it and make it faster and more robust.
Since then, we've had all kinds of recognition.
We've gained a lot of prizes.
Remember, it's free, none of us is making money with this.
Everything comes out of our own pockets.
The prizes were the type, "Oh, this is fantastic.
Armstrong tweet something about us, and then, in December, Time magazine recognized us as one of the top 50 inventions in 2010, and it was really cool.
The best thing about this -- and this is what ends up to close the circles -- is that in April this year in the MIT Geographic Center, there is going to be an exhibition called "Art in the Streets."
And "Art in the Streets is going to have the best experts of urban art, Bradian American, CAPTCHA, -- all of them are going to be there.
TEEB is going to be on the show which is pretty impressive.
So, basically this is my idea: if you see something that is not possible, to make it possible.
None of what there is in this room was possible -- the stage, the computer, the microphone, the School, nothing was possible at a certain time.
I can make it possible -- anything in this room.
I'm not a programmer, I never did anything with hidden recognition technology, I just recognized something and associated with wonderful people to be able to make it happen.
And these are the questions that I want all of us all to do every day when we find something that we feel like you have to do. If it's not now, when. And if I'm not me, who?"
Thank you guys.
I've spent the last few years going into very difficult situations and at the same time a dangerous time.
I went to prison -- hard.
I worked on a coal mine -- dangerous.
Film in war areas -- difficult and dangerous.
And I spent 30 days eating this -- fun at first, something difficult in the middle, very dangerous at the end.
In fact, in a lot of my career, I've been setting up in situations at the very only goal of trying to look at social issues in ways that are attractive, interesting, and hopefully analyze them in a way that look at entrepreneurs and accessible to the audience.
So when I knew that I would come here and make a TEDTalk about the world of brands and the sponsor wanted to do something a little different.
So some of you may have heard of, or not, a couple weeks ago, I took a pig in eBay.
I sent some messages on Facebook, some on Twitter, I offered the rights of my TEDTalk in 2011.
What I had was this: AIDS Sun Project: My TEDTalk that you have no idea what it is, and according to the face, especially if I put it in ridiculous to you or your company to do it.
But I said this, it's a very good media opportunity.
Do you know how many people look at these TEDTalks?
A lot.
It's a title in progress.
So even with that angle I knew someone was going to buy the rights of the name.
If you had asked me a year ago, I couldn't tell you with certainty.
But in the new film I am working on, we look at the marketing world, of advertising.
And as I said before, I've been in horrible situations in the last few years, but nothing could prepare me, nothing could anticipate for something as difficult or as dangerous as entering the rooms with these guys.
You see, I had this idea for a movie.
Morgan Spanish," I want to make a film that deals with the power of products, the marketing and the advertising, and that all the film is funded with products of products, marketing and advertising.
The movie is going to call "The largest film ever sell."
What happens in "The largest movie ever sold is that everything up to bottom, from beginning to end, has brand images, all the time, from the analysis that appears before the title, the X-ray brand.
Now this brand, Alan Stage, the Stage Center.
These people are going to be associated to the bottom of the phone forever.
And so the film explores all this idea.  (Music Kapping: It's a driver. Is it what? (MR: Is it a driver for you?
I'm a reduce pedestrian. (MR: I just say it -- it was more likely to do.
It was "It's "sport." forever."
But we're not just going to have the X-ray from the X brand in the title, but we're going to make sure that we're going to make sure that we took all the categories that we could on the film.
Maybe we sell a shoe, and it becomes the most great shoe you've used to use.
The most great car you've ever been driving in "The largest movie ever sell, the best thing you've ever babies, cuts from "The largest film ever sell."
Java Koso: The idea is then in addition to showing the brands as part of life, making them fund the film? (MS: To make it fund the film -- MS: And we actually show the whole process of how it works.
The goal of the whole film is transparency.
You're going to see all the process in this film.
That's the whole idea, the whole film of the beginning to end.
And I would love that CEO helps make it happen.
Robert Friedman: You know, it's funny because it's the first time I hear that -- it's the ultimate respect for the audience.
Guy, though, I don't know how receptor people are going to be.
MK: You have a perspective -- I don't know if "National is very negative, but you know how it's going to repeat? (MS: No idea. David Coke," how much money do you need to do this?
MS: A million and a half million -- (Audience: All right. John Kamen: I think it's going to be hard for the meeting with them, but it certainly is going to be worth convince a couple big brands.
JC: Who knows, maybe for the moment that the movie comes out, we see us like a lot of collective languages.
MS: What do you think is going to be the answer?
Stuart Rudan: Most responses will be "No."
MS: But will it be hard to sell it, for the film or to be me?
JK: Both of these things.
MS: ... means you're not very optimistic.
So, help me? I need help.
MK: I can help.
MS: All right. (MR: Okay. Awesome.
MK: We have to think about what brands are.
MS: Yes. (MR: That's the challenge -- when you look at the people you have to deal with.
MK: We have some places where to go. (MS: Okay. Turn out the camera.
MS: I thought he completed the camera -- it meant we have a conversation outside the microphone.
It turns out the camera means "We don't want to know anything about your film.
MS: And so it was, one by one, all these companies suddenly disappeared.
None of you wanted to have nothing to do with this film.
I was surprised.
They didn't want to know anything about this project.
And I was very impressed -- I thought that the concept of advertising, was to present the product to as many people as possible, to make as many people as possible.
Especially in the world today this intersection of new media and old media and the stage of separate media, is not the idea to tell that new gift of attention that is going to take the message to the mass?
No, that's what I thought.
But the problem was, you see, my idea had a garage error and that error was this.
Actually, no, there was no mistake.
There was no mistake at all.
This would have been fine.
But the problem was what this image means.
See, when you look for transparency images in Google --   -- this is one of the first images that come out.
I like your way to roll, Sergey Brian. No.
This was the problem: the transparency -- free of simulation or deception -- easily detected or watched -- easily understanding -- that is characterized by the visible or accountability of information, especially in business practices -- being the last line perhaps the biggest problem.
You see, we hear a lot about transparency in these days.
Our politicians name it, the president name, even the CEOs will name.
But all of a sudden when it's about making it reality something really changes.
But why? Well, transparency gives fear --  -- like that weird bear that still keeps organized.
It's impossible --   Like this rare path path.
And it's also very risky.
What else is it risky?
It will eat a whole rise of College White.
That's very risky.
When I started talking to companies and saying that we wanted to tell this story, and they said, "No, we want a story.
We want to tell you a story, but you tell our story."
See, when I was a kid, and my father took me into some lying, and there he is looking at me as he used to do it -- he said, "Son, there are three sides in every story.
There's your story, it's my story, and it's the real story.
As you see, in this film we wanted to tell the real story.
But with just one company, an agency wanted to help me -- and that just because I knew John Bond and Richard Kiribati for many years -- I realized I would have to go through my own, I would have to remove the international and go to companies myself with all my team.
So what I started to warn suddenly -- what I started to realize -- is that when you start to talk to companies the idea of understanding your brand is a universal problem.
MS: I have friends who make big movies, huge months, giant and others who make small movies, independent like mine.
And my friends who make big Hollywood films, giant holistics, say that the reason their films are so successful is due to the associated brands that they have.
And then my friends who make independent movies say, "Well, how are we supposed to compete with these big, giant Hollywood films, right?
And the film is called "The largest movie ever sell."
How are we going to see Baye specifically in the movie.
Every time I'm going to go out, every time I open my button, you'll see the Bank Bank.
At any time during an interview with someone I can say, "Are you very cool for this interview?
Are you ready? You see a little nervous.
I want to help you calm up.
Maybe you should put a little bit of this before the interview."
And there's one of these fabulous artists.
Both Fundamental Fear as "The Parameter Viewpends are going to have its opportunity.
We're going to have as much for man like a woman, solid slave, barrel, barrier, whatever.
That's the general look.
Now I can answer your questions and give you a prototype look.
Karen Frank: We are a small brand.
So similar to the kind of smaller movies you would tell us, we're more good a rival brand.
That's why we don't have the budget that have other brands.
So doing things like this, you know, remember Bangladesh to people is the reason that this interests us.
MS: What words would you use to describe Bang?
Bang is in white.
KF: That's a big question.
Woman: higher technology.
MS: Technology is not the way you want to describe something that you put in the air.
Man: We talk about something bold -- fresh.
I think "French is a great word that actually puts this category in positive versus smell and sublim."
It keeps you cold.
How do you keep failed more time? With better school, more friends, three times more fresh time.
Things like those who make the benefits.
MS: And that's a multi-dimensional company.
What about me? What about a common guy.
I need to talk to the man in the street, the people like me, to the ordinary papers.
They have to talk about my brand.
MS: How do you define your market?
Man: Mam my market?
I don't know.
I like a good clothing.
Woman: It will revive the '80s, public paradigm unless it's day of landing.
MS: All right, what's the Germany?
German: One single thing. (MS: unique. Man: I guess the kind of gender -- the style I have to be like a dark glamour."
I like the dark colors, many gray colleges and things like that.
Usually I wear access to sunglasses, or I like crystals and similar.
Woman: If Dan was a brand could be a classic conversation, Mercers Bene.
Man 2: The brand I am, I would call it casual flight.
Woman 2: In part of history, in part and part of the biomass, partly Brooklyn, I don't know.
Man 3: I am the kind of pessimists.
selling toys for pets in the country and in the world.
So I guess that's my brand.
In my little sector, that's my brand.
Man 4: My brand is Federaus, because I teach the market.
Man 5: All right.
Is that anything?
Audience: I'm a lawyer.
Tom, I'm Tom.
MS: Well, not all of us can be brand Tom, but I often classify the intersection of dark glamour and flat flight.
I realized I needed an expert.
I needed somebody who could go into my head, somebody who could help me understand what they call the "share personality."
And I found a company called Oxford Zaloric in Pittsburgh.
They helped companies like Neanderthal, February, Harlem to discover that brand personality.
If they could do it for them, they could surely do it for me.
Obama], traveled the photos, right?
MS: Yes. The first picture is a family photo.
A: Tell me a little bit how it relates to your thoughts and feelings your way to be.
MS: These people model my way to see the world.
A: Tell me about that world.
MS: That world? I think your world is the world that you live in, as the people around you, your friends, your family, the way you live your life, the work you do.
All of those things are originated and start in a place and in my case, and you start in my family, West Virginia.
A: What's the next thing you want to talk about?
MS: The next one is this was the best day of my life."
A: How does this relate to your thoughts, feelings and your way to be?
MS: It's like who I want to be me.
I like different things.
I like weird things. I like weird things.
A: Tell me about "why" -- why does that serve us?
What's the magic? What phase phase are you now?
Why is it important? What does the red mean?
Tell me a little bit about that.
A little more of you, which is not who you are.
What other metaphors have you had?
It doesn't have to be fear. What kind of route are you?
MS: Oh!  Thank you.) No, thank you.
A: Thank you for your patience, (Mr. Great job. A, yeah. (CA: Thank you very much. All right.
MS: Yeah, I don't know what is going to come out of this.
There was a lot of crazy in all this.
Linux Zaloon: The first thing I saw was this idea that there are two different sides -- but complementary -- in your brand personality brand, the Morgan Spanish brand is a consumer brand.
They sat very well together.
And I think there's almost a paradox in them.
And I think some companies will only focus on one of their strong points or the other instead of focusing on both.
A lot of companies tend to -- and it's human nature -- to avoid the things that are not safe -- avoid fear, those elements, and you actually give them a little bit and make them become a positive thing for you, and it's nice to see that.
What other brands are it?
The first here is the classic one, Apple.
And you can see also here to Tarah, Win, Minister of Minister Copenhagen and Jetusia.
Now there are conscious marks and conscious brands -- those things that have gone and come up with a decision-making is pretty powerful.
MS: A decision brand. What's your mark?
If someone asks you to describe your identity, your brand personality -- what would it be?
Are you a alternative attribute -- you're somebody who makes blood flow?
Or are you more good a decrease adopted?
A little bit more calculated, reserved, conservative?
The advanced attributes are like being a playful to be fresh like El Prince, contemporary -- advertise, addiction or bold as Egypt Flore, fast or gay, deep, magnetic, magic or magic like Gandhi.
Or are you more attractive than decrease decrease?
Are you conscious -- sophisticated like 1:30?
Are you stationarily, tradition, protection, protective -- you identify with Opera?
Are you reliable, stable, family, reliable safe, contact or safe, like the Dalai Lama or So So?
In the course of this film, we had over 500 companies, ancient and decline, who said, "No, they didn't want to be part of this project.
They didn't want to have anything to do with this film, mainly because they wouldn't have control, they wouldn't have control on the final product.
They allowed us to tell the story of neuroscience, and we came to tell the story in this film of how they now use magnetic resonance to identify the centers of desire in the brain both for commercial marketing as a movie.
We went to San Paulo.
Throughout the city for the past five years, there are no balls, no cards, no flags, nothing.
And we went to school districts where companies are doing road in schools with pencil problems in the United States.
The incredible thing to me is that the projects in which I've had the greatest answer or what I've had more successful are those in which I've been interacting with things directly.
And that's what these marks did.
They removed the international, they took their agencies, and they said maybe these agencies don't have my best interest in mind.
I'm going to treat directly with the artist.
I'm going to work with him to create something different, something that's going to make people think, who's going to challenge the way we look at the world.
And how do you have gone? Did they get successful?
Well, since the movie is shown in the Sweden Festival -- let's take a look.
According to Burkers, the movie is shown in January, and since then -- and this is not -- we've had 900 million impressions in the media for this film.
This covers only a two and a half weeks.
That's just online -- no press or TV.
The film is still not distributed yet.
It's still not online. It's not in a stranger.
It's not even presented in other countries yet.
Ultimately, this film has already begun to win momentum.
And it's not bad because almost all the agencies that we talked about was being part of their customers not being a part.
I've always believed that if you risk you, if you take risks, that in those risks there are opportunities.
I think when you take people out of that you're pushing them into failure.
I believe that when you train your employees in the aversion to the risk is preparing all its company to get a reward.
I feel that what has to happen to move is that we have to encourage people to risk.
We have to encourage people to have no fear of the opportunities that they can scare them.
Ultimately, moving forward, I think we have to give the fear.
We have to put that bear in a cage.
We add fear. We add the risk.
From a hungry at a time, we have to embrace risk.
And ultimately, we have to smell transparency.
More than ever a little bit of honesty is going to run a long way.
And I said this, with honesty and transparency, all my talk "We "about the Transition has been presented by my good friends of EMIS who were by 7,000 buying the rights of the name in eBay.
EC: Becoming big data in big opportunities for companies around the world.
And the ELH presents the Transition."
Thank you very much people.
June Cohen: So Morgan, in behalf of transparency, that happened exactly with those 27?
MS: It's an exceptional question.
In my pocket I have a gift to the name of the TED care, the Saliban Foundation, a cocktail for 7,000 to be applied to my attendance for the next year.
The idea behind the Stunturing computer worm is actually very simple.
We don't want Iran to get the nuclear bomb.
Their biggest asset to develop nuclear weapons is the rise plant in National Nation.
The gray boxes that you see are control systems in real time.
If we get to compromise these systems that control speed and valves -- we can cause a lot of problems with the center.
The gray boxes don't use Windows software -- they're from a completely different technology.
But if we managed to put an effective virus from Windows in a wearable computer used by an engineer to drive this gray box, then we are ready.
This is the plan behind Studence.
We started with a Windows.
The pressure goes into the gray box, damaged the center, and the Iranian nuclear program is demonstrated, mission.
It's easy, huh?
I want to tell you how we discovered this.
When we started researching about Stone six months ago, the purpose was completely unknown about it.
The only thing that was known is that it's very, very complex in the Windows part -- the viewer used multiple dark vulnerability.
I seemed to do something with these gray boxes, these control systems.
That called us attention, and we started an experiment where we infected our environment with Studence and we saw what happened to this.
So they went through very strange things.
Studence was behaving as a lab rat that he didn't like our cheese, I waves, but I didn't want to eat.
It didn't make sense for me.
And after experimenting with different cheese flavors -- I realized, and I thought, this is a targeted attack.
It's completely drive."
The viewer is actively looking at the gray box if you find a specific configuration, and even if the program that is trying to infect is effectively working on that place.
If not, Scotting does nothing.
So that called my attention, and we started working on this almost 24 hours a day, because I thought, "We don't know what the goal is.
It could be, say, for example, an energy plant, or a chemical plant in Germany.
Better we'll discover the goal soon.
So we extracted and we declared the addiction code, and we found that it was structured in two digital bombs -- a little and a big one.
We also saw that they were really armed by people who obviously had all the internal information.
They knew all the points that I will attack.
You probably even know how much the operator is.
So you know everything.
And if you've heard that the Stone bombsight is complex and high technology, let me tell you, the burden is very complex.
It's very much above everything we've seen before.
Here you see a sample of this code of attack.
We're talking about 15,000 lines of code.
It looks pretty much like the old assembly language.
I want to tell you how we could find sense to this code.
What we were looking for at the beginning were called the systems of the system, because we know what they do.
Then we looked for temperatures and data structures and tried to relate to the real world, with potential targets in the real world.
We need theories about designers that we can approve or disappear.
To get to theories about goals, we remember that it's definitely a violent satellite, it must be a valuable white, and it's surely located in Iran because it's where most infections have been represented.
You don't find several thousands of targets in that area.
It's basically reduced to the nuclear power plant in Boston and the National England Protein.
So I told my assistant, "Let me give you a list of all experts in centers and power plants between our clients.
He called them and made them in an effort to get their experience with what we found in code and data.
And it worked pretty well.
So we could associate the little digital purple with the control of the robot.
The robot is that cell part inside the center, that black object you see.
If you drive the speed of this robot, you can certainly turn it and even make the center explode.
What we also saw is that the goal of the attack was to make it slow and discovered in an obvious effort to go back to the nest maintenance engineers, so that they couldn't solve this quickly.
We tried to decipher the big digital purpose very much about the data and their structures.
So for example, the 14th of the submarine in that code, you can't be obvious.
I started researching scientific literature about how these centers are built in Nature and found that they're structured in what is called a waterfall and each waterfall contains 14 centrals.
That made sense, there was a coincidence.
And it got better yet.
These candidates in Iran are divided in 15 parts called stages.
And guess what we find in the attack code of attack?
A almost identical structure.
So again, that was a good coincidence.
This gave us a lot of confidence to understand what we had in the hands.
For no guards, it wasn't like this.
The results have been made after several weeks of hard work.
We usually ended up in classrooms without coming out, and we had to start back again.
Yet, we found out that both digital peaks were pointing to one and the same goal, but from different angles.
The small purple is taking a waterfall and making the robots and relativity them, and the big girl is communicating with six waterfall and manipulating values.
In fact, we're very confident that we've determined what the fate is.
It's Natasha, and it's just Natasha.
We shouldn't worry that other goals will be achieved by Stonewall.
Here I show you a few very interesting things that we saw, really impressed me.
There's the gray box, and you see the centrals there.
What this thing is doing is to intercept the input values of the sensors for example, from pressure sensors and vibration sensors and provides legitimate code, which still execute during the attack, with false input data.
And believe it or not, these fake data data is progressed by Stonewall.
It's like the Hollywood movies where, during the theft, the security camera is feeding a primary video.
Is it great one?
The idea here is obviously not only to burn the operators in the control room.
It's really much more dangerous and agreed.
The idea is to build a digital security system.
We need digital security systems where a human operator could not act fast.
For example, in an energy plant, when the big steam turbines go out of speed, you have to open up space valve in a milliseconds.
Obviously, this can't make it a human operator.
That's where we need digital security systems.
And when they're engaged -- bad things can happen.
The plant can exploit it.
And not the operations or the security system will tell you.
That scares that.
But it can be worse.
What I'm going to say is very important.
Think about this. This attack is generous.
It has nothing to see, specifically with centrals, with endangered overall.
It could work also, for example, in a power plant.
It's generous.
And you don't have -- but you don't have -- that will distinguish this load with a USB key, as we saw in the case of Studence.
You could also use conventional technologies to disseminate it.
Bring it more possible.
And if you did that, with what you would end up with is a system of mass destruction.
That's the consequence we should face.
Unfortunately, the largest number of targets for such attacks is not in the Middle East.
It's in the United States and Japan.
All green areas are spaces with large numbers of goals.
We should face the consequences and better than we start to prepare now.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: I have a question.
Ralph has been done in many sides that people assume that the Boston is the main entity behind this.
What's your opinion?
Ralph Langley," OK, you really want to hear this?
Yes. Okay.
My opinion is that the Boston is involved, but the engine is not Israel.
And the engine behind this is the cyber surface.
There is one single one, and that's the United States, fortunately, fortunately, fortunately, the United States.
Because otherwise, our problems would be even larger.
CA: Thank you for living. Thank you, Ralia.
I want you to imagine a robot that you can take and give them subject skills, or another one that makes you users of wheelchair go up and go back to walk.
In Berkeley, we call these robots, externalities.
They're not different from something that is put in the morning, gives you a big force -- that it also increases your speed, and it helps you, for example, to manage the balance.
It's actually the real integration of man and machine.
But not only that -- you can integrate it and connect it to the universe and with other external ones.
This is not an irregular idea.
So to show you now in what we're working on, we start talking about the American soldier that, in average, it has to take over its back a 45-year-old charge -- and it's going to be getting even more team.
Obviously, this leads to some important complications -- injuries in the back, 30 percent of the soldiers -- with chronic damage.
We decided to take this challenge and create an exoskeleton that could help handle the issue.
Let me introduce you to the STRM -- or Portugal Human Carsets.
Soldier: With the HIV exoskeleton I can get 90 pounds per variable land for many hours.
Their flexible design, it allows you to put in climates and run and execute movement with great agility of it.
It perceives what I want to do, or where I want to go, and then raise my strength and my resistance.
Stage Benjamin: We're ready, with our industrial partner to produce this device, this new exoskeleton this year.
I mean, it's a reality.
We go back now looking at the users of wheelchair chairs, about what I feel particularly passionate about.
There are 68 million people about it, in wheelchair chairs, around the world.
About one percent of the total population.
And this is a really conservative calculation here.
We talk about something that happens with frequency -- very young people, with damage in the village that when they start their life -- at the age 20, 30 or 40 -- they collide a wall and the wheelchair turns out to be their only choice.
We also talk about the population that is moving very quickly.
Their only choice, many times -- for a brain injury or some other complicated complication.
And this has been for the last 500 years, from its successful approach, as I should recognize.
So we decided to start writing a new chapter about mobility.
Let me introduce you the ELL that's using Amanda Bottom who was 19 years ago in the spinal column, and as a result, I couldn't walk back for 19 years, so far.
Amanda Botospoct: Thank you.
EB: Amanda is using our ELL, which I mentioned.
It's got a few sensors.
Not completely invasive in the tolls that send signals to the bus computer here in the back.
There are also some batteries that give the motors energy in the hips and in the knees, and they make it move with this soft and very natural going.
AB: I was 24 years old at the top of my life when, by a weird jump in the air, skiing up a little bit paralyzed.
In a fraction of second, I lost every feeling and all movement from the slope down.
A little bit later, a doctor walked into my room in the hospital, and he said, "Amazing, you'll never walk.
That happened 19 years ago.
So I ran up to the last piece of hope of my being.
The adoption technology since then, has allowed me to learn how to describe it down in skeletons, climbing rocks and even riding in a hand bicycle.
But they haven't invented anything that allowed me to walk, so far.
Thank you.
EB: As you can see, we have the technology, we have the platforms to sit and talk to you.
It's in our hands, and we have all the potential here to change the life to future generations -- not just by soldiers, but to Amanda and to all the users of the wheelchair, all of them.
AB: Thank you.
I just came back from a community that has the secret of human survival.
It's a place where women have the battle, they practice sex to say hello, and play is the order of the day -- where the fun is serious.
And no, it's not the Federal Man Festival or San Francisco.
Ladies and gentlemen, they know their cousins.
This is the world of the wild Bonobos in the forest of Congo.
The bonobos are, along with chimpanzees, their closest living relatives, closest lands.
That means that we all share a common ancestor, an evolutionary grandmother, who lived about six million years ago.
Now, chimpanzees are known for their assault, right?
But unfortunately, we've made too much emphasis in this aspect in our narrative of human evolution.
But the bonobos show us the other side of the coin.
Whereas chimpanzees are dominated by big guys, terrifying society, Bonobos society is in charge of female power.
These guys have created something special -- because this leads to a very tolerant society where the deadly violence has not observed yet.
But unfortunately the bonobos are the least understood of the big apes, unfortunately.
They live in the depths of the Congolese rainforest, and it's been very hard to study them.
The Congo is a paradox -- a land of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty, but also the heart of the thing -- stage of a violent conflict that has been produced by decades and caused almost as many deaths as the First World War.
It's not surprising that this destruction also puts the survival of the Bonobo.
The commercial meat trade and deforestation make you can't fill a stadium with the bonobos that are in the world -- and honestly, we're not sure of it.
However, in this land of violence and chaos, you can hear the laughter hidden by making the trees.
Who are these primates?
We know them as the apes make love, not war -- because they have a frequent sex and market and bisexual to handle conflict and solve social problems.
I'm not saying that this is the solution to all the problems of humanity because the life of Bonobos is more than the Kamman Street.
Bonobos, as humans, they love playing throughout their entire life.
Player is not just a game of children.
For us, and for them the game is fundamental to establish links and to promote the tolerance, to be the tone.
We learn to trust, and we learn the rules of the game.
Play increases creativity and resilience, and it has to do with the generation of diversity -- diversity of interactions, behavioral diversity, behavioral diversity.
And when you look at the Bonobo game sees the evolutionary roots itself, the dance and the human ritual.
Play is the glue that unites us.
I don't know how you play you, but I want to show you a couple of unique videos of the wild medium.
First of all, it's a broken ball game, and I don't talk about football flight.
Here we have a female and a young male in the middle of a perspective.
Look what she is doing.
It could be the evolutionary origin of the phrase, "The balls of the photos."
I just believe that in this case he loves him, right?
Yes.
So sexual game is common as well as in booms as humans.
And this video is really interesting because it shows -- this video is really interesting because it shows the inventory of bringing unusual elements into play -- like the testicles -- and also how game requires trust and promotes trust -- and at the same time it's the most fun.
But play is policy.
The game is policy, it can adopt a lot of forms, some of which are more confident, imagination, curious, maybe the place where the awe is collected.
And I want you to see -- this is Furnalia, a young female who is playing with water.
I think that we sometimes play alone, and we explore the limits of our inner and outside worlds.
And it's that playful curiosity that drives us to explore, to interact, and then the unexpected connections that we form are the actual seed of creativity.
These are just little samples of the understanding that Bonobos give us about our past and present.
But they also have a secret for our future, a future where we have to adapt to a more difficult world with greater creativity and greater cooperation.
The secret is that game is the key to these capabilities.
In other words, game is our complex adaptation.
To adapt to a world that changes we need to play.
But take care of the maximum of our game?
The game is not fundamental.
Play is essential.
For Bonobo and humans, life is not just cruel and shooting.
When it looks like the least appropriate play, they can be the moments when it's the most urgent thing.
So promised, primates, we accept this gift of evolution and play together as we rediscover creativity, friendship and wonder.
Thank you.
In New York I'm responsible for development of a nonprofit organization called Robin Hoove.
When I am not fighting poverty, I combine increases as a captain assistant in a volunteer bomb.
And in our city, where volunteers are doing a highly skilled staff you have to get to the site of the fire very soon to get into action.
I remember my first fire.
I was the second volunteer on the site, so I had a pretty high probability to go.
But still there was a career to foot against the other volunteers to get to charge and figure out what our task was.
When I found the captain of the captain -- I was focused on a conversation with the property that I certainly would have had one of the worst days of his life.
We were at night, she was standing outside in the rain, under a parallel, displaced, distantly, while his house was on fire.
The other volunteer that I had just arrived before I was -- let's call me Lester Luthur --  came first to the captain and he asked him to go into and save the dog of the house.
The dog, I was so clear."
There I was an attorney or a money management who, during the rest of his life, would have to tell people that I came into a building building to save a living thing only because I won for five seconds.
Well, I was the next one.
The captain made me an administration.
He said, "Beines, I need to get the house.
I need it to come up, bring the fire, and bring this woman to a couple of shoes."
I swear it.
It wasn't exactly what I expected, but I went -- I took the stairs. At the end of the hall, I went to the real firefighters that I had to do more or less had finished to turn the fire and entered the main room in search for a couple of shoes.
I know what you're thinking, but I'm not a hero.
I took my payload back through the ladder where I met my New News and the precious dog on the front door.
We took out of the house for the owner of the house where, as it was to expect, their treasure.
A few weeks later, the department got a letter from the owner of home graduating by the brave effort to save their home.
The kindness that she saw about the other was that someone had reached him even a couple of shoes.
Both in my voice in Robin Hood, as in my voice as a voluntary fire I'm a witness of the acts of generosity and kindness in a monumental scale, but also of acts and companies at the individual level.
And you know what I've learned?
Everything has its importance.
So when I look at this room to people who have achieved or they are to achieve -- remarkable success levels, I'd like to remind you this: Don't wait.
They don't wait to win the first million to make the difference in somebody's life.
If you have something to give, do it now.
They serve food in a dining dining park a neighborhood park.
Be mentors.
Not every day we're going to have the opportunity to save somebody's life, but every day we're going to be able to influence somebody's life.
So they go into the game -- they save the shoes.
Thank you.
Bruno Giussani: Mark, Mark, back.
Mark Bees," thank you.
This may seem strange -- but I'm a big fan of the concrete block.
The first concrete blocks were made in 1868 with a very simple idea: models of a fixed measure that fit each other.
Very quickly, these became the most used construction unit in the world.
They have allowed us to build bigger things than us, like buildings or bridges, a brick at a time.
Essentially, these blocks have become the pillars of our time.
Almost a hundred years later, in 1947 to LED was happening this.
He called a cardial assembly chicken.
And in a few years, LED bricks came to every home.
It's estimated that they've made over 400 billion or 75 bricks per person on the planet.
You don't have to be engineering to build beautiful bridges, buildings or houses.
LED made it accessible.
LED simply adopted the concrete block, the favorite in the world, and turned it into a fundamental piece of our imagination.
Meanwhile, exactly that same year, in the Bell labs, the next revolution was about to announce: the new building block.
The transistor was a small unit of plastic that would take us from a world of aesthetic brick all over the other to a world where everything was interactive.
Like the concrete block, the transistor allows us to create a lot of bigger and more complex circuits -- a brick at a time.
But there's a main difference -- the transistor was just for experts.
I personally don't accept it, that the building blocks of our time are reserved to experts, so I decided to change it.
Eight years ago, when I was at the Media Lab, I began to explore the idea of bringing the power of engineers to the hands of artists and designers.
A few years ago, I started developing Littsheares.
I'm going to show you how they work.
Little little electronics are electronic modules each with specific function.
They're predicted to be light, sound, engines and sensors.
And the best thing about it is that they come together through images.
So you can't put it wrong.
The bricks have a code of color.
The green is the coming out, the blue is the current, the pink is the entrance and the orange of the orange is the blade.
So you only have to assemble a blue with a green and you can very quickly start to make greater circuits.
A blue with a green produce light.
We can put a button in the middle and we have a regulator.
If you change the button by a pulse of pulse, which is here, and now we have an interesting light.
We added this thing to create more impact and we have a noise machine.
I'm going to stop this.
So beyond simple play, Little Latin are actually very powerful.
Instead of having to program and connect and save, Titus allows us to program using very simple intuitive gestures.
To make it faster or slower and just spin this button that makes the pulse faster or slower.
The idea behind Littis is that it's a growing collection.
We want all of the interactions in the world to reduce the leaders ready to use.
Light, sounds, solar panels -- everything must be accessible.
We've given Littsheares to kids to see them playing with them.
And it's been an incredible experience.
The best thing is how they start to understand electronics of every day that doesn't learn in schools.
For example, how a light works, or why the door of an elevator is held open, or how an iPod responds to touch.
We've also taken Littsheares to design schools.
So for example, designers without an electronics begin to play literary lines like a material.
So here you can see, with paper bottles and flight, we have George creating the thing.
(Music sounds)  A few weeks ago, we took Littsheares to Rhode Island School designers, who don't have any experience in engineering, just in card, wood and paper and said, do something.
Here's an example of a project that you've done -- an active conference cannon.
But wait, here comes my favorite project.
It's a large player made of playfulness that is afraid of darkness.
For these not engineers, Titus became another material, electronics became another material.
And we want this material to be aware of all.
So Titus has open code.
You can visit the website, download all of the design files and make them happen.
We want to encourage a world of creators and inventors and collaborators because this world we live, this interactive world, is ours.
So forward and to invent it.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you today about unexpected discoveries.
I work in the solar technology industry.
And my little company is looking for us to engage with the environment focusing on the environment.
It's distributed collaboration.
This is a little video of what we do.
Hmm. Wait for a moment.
You can do a little bit of demonstration.
We can go better and we can get the video on one side.
No.
This is not.
All right.
Solar technology is ...
Oh, I am given the time?
All right. Thank you very much.
A couple of years ago, I launched an initiative to recruit the best designers and techniques so they take a year and work in an environment that represents almost everything that is supposed to portray -- we asked them to work in government.
The initiative was called "Every American "Forest," and they would be like body Peace Personal people.
We selected some members every year and we put them to work with the mentors.
Instead of sending them to the Third World Web we sent them into the wild world.
They made big applications -- they worked with the municipal employees.
Your task is to show the possibilities of the technology today.
You know Al Allen.
It's a habitat from the city of Boston.
Here it appears as if I look for a date, but what it really looks for is that someone is clean up by the snow because it knows that it's not very good at going on fire when it's covered by a meter of snow.
How did he ask for help in such simple?
Last year in Boston, we had a team of members of "God for America."
They were there in February, and at that time, it was a lot of last year.
They realized that the city never cleaned these habitats.
But one of the members named Erik Michellers noticed something else, that citizens cleaned up with pales right in front of them.
So it did like any good programmer, developed an app.
It's a nice application where you can adopt a habitat.
You accept clean it when you snow.
By doing so, you put a name, in this case, I put it.
If you don't do it, somebody can steal it.
I mean, it has a playful component.
It's a modest application.
Maybe it's the smallest of the 21 scheduled applications last year.
But it does something that no other government technology does.
And it extends a viral way.
One responsible for the city of Honoru City to see this app realized that I could use it, not for snow, but for citizens to adopt the tablets of tablet.
It's very important that these swamps work, but people steal the battery.
And so it asks citizens to control them.
And then Seattle decided to use it to make citizens break up the capitalized disasters.
And Chicago just launch it to make people register to clean sidewalks when they snow.
So now we know nine cities plan to use it.
And this has been spread without friction and organic and natural.
If you know a little bit of government technology that this doesn't normally happen.
software acquisition usually takes a couple of years.
Last year in Boston, we had a team working on a project that required three people for two and a half months.
It was a tool so that parents could choose the best public school for their children.
Then they told us that they had done for normal channels that would have taken at least two years and cost about two million dollars.
And that's not anything.
Now there's a project in the California Julin power that even the time has cost 2,000 million dollars and it doesn't work.
And there are projects like this in every level of government.
So an application that is programmed in a couple of days, and it's spread in viral form, it's a kind of time of advertisers to the institution of government.
It suggests the best way to work, not like private companies, like many people think it should be.
Not as a technological company, but rather like the Internet.
I mean, without answers, open and general form.
And that's important.
But the most important thing about this app is that it represents the way that we can address the question of the government that has new generation -- not as a problem of an analytical institution but as a collective action problem.
And that's very good because it turns out we are very good at collective action with digital technology.
And there is a very large community of people who are building the tools to work together with efficacy.
And it's not just "A State for America, but there are hundreds of people all over the country that contribute to civic applications every day in their own communities.
They haven't been given to the government.
They feel a great frustration before that, but they don't complain about it.
And these people know something we've lost from view.
And it is that if we leave the feelings about politics, the line at the DNA Recent Autonomy, and all of those other things that make us crazy -- the government is, essentially, in Tim Rule words, "What we do together because we just can't can."
Now, many people have left the government.
If you are one of those people, I would ask you to remember it, because things are changing.
Politics doesn't change the government.
And because the government at the end of us, they remember that of us, the people? The way to think about it will affect the way to produce change.
I didn't know a lot of government when I started this.
And as a lot of people thought that government is to choose people to be able to get loads to it.
Well, after two years I've come to the conclusion that the government is, most of all, of alligators.
This is the center of services of services and information.
It's the place that serves the calls if you mark 31 in the United States.
Scott landed this call.
You entered Zandel at the base of official knowledge.
I didn't find anything. It started with animal control.
And he finally said, "Hey, can you open up the doors of the house, put music right and see if you go?
And it worked. So for Scott.
But that wasn't the end of the rains.
Boston doesn't have a call center.
It has an app and web and mobile called Connections Connection."
We don't program that application.
It was the work of very smart people in the New Mechanical Mechanical Medical Mexico.
One day, this actually happened, comes this say, "Barry in my trash cube -- I don't know if it's dead.
How do I do that?
The Connecticut Syndemical dynamics is different.
Scott was talking in person.
In Science Connection everything is public, so everybody can see this.
In this case, I saw a neighbor.
The next report said, "I came up to the place, I found the garbage cube behind the house.
Zander? Yes. Life? Yes.
I turned the cube back. I went home.
Good night, sweet landscape."
Quite simple.
This is great. It's the confluence of digital and physical.
And it's also a great example of the government income to distributed voluntary collaboration.
But it's also a great example of government as a platform.
And here I don't necessarily mean the technical definition of platform.
I talk about a platform so that people are hearing and helping others.
So, one citizen helped another but here the government had a key role.
He connected to two people.
And I could have connected to you with the government services of being necessary, but the neighbor is a better alternative and cheaper than government services.
When one neighbor helps another, we strengthen communities.
If we call animals control, it costs a lot of money.
One important thing we have to think about the government is that it's not the same as politics.
A lot of people understand it, but think that one is the entrance of the other.
That our entry to the government system is the vote.
How many times have you chosen a political leader -- sometimes we spend a lot of energy to choose a new political leader and then we hope that government reflects our values and satisfying our needs, but then we don't see changes.
That is because the government is like an open ocean and politics is the surface layer of 15 inches away.
And below is what we call Burker.
And we say that word with a lot of contempt.
But it is that respect that keeps us that that we are funded as something that operates in our against it, that other thing, and we are losing power.
People think politics is silent.
If we want this institution to work, we will have to make the bureaucracy sexy.
Because that's where the true government work occurs.
We have to collaborate with the government machine.
That makes the Allende movement.
Have you seen them?
It's a group of concerned citizens who have written a very detailed report from 32 pages in response to the order of the SETI for the financial reform project.
That's not political activity, it's bureaucratic activity.
And for those of us who have resisted in the government, it's time we ask ourselves what world we want to leave our children.
You have to see the huge challenges that they will have to face.
Do you really think we're going to get where we have to go without solving the institution that can act in behalf of all?
We can't predict government, we need to be more effective.
The good news is that with technology is possible to rethink government function so that it can expand to the civil society.
There's a generation that grew up with the Internet and knows that it's not so hard to act massively, you only have to articulate the systems in the right way.
The average age of our members is 28 years old, so I am a greater generation than many of them.
This is a generation that has grown up taking the word and giving that almost by granted.
They're not giving that battle that we all face about who's going to talk about -- they're all going to speak.
They can express their opinions in any channel at the same time, and they do.
So when they face the government problem, they don't really care a lot about making their voices.
They're using your hands.
They put hands to the work to program applications that make government better.
And those applications allow us to use our hands to improve our communities.
It can be cleaning up a habitat, taking off balls, dumping a garbage cube that has a rapid barrier.
Of course, we could always have cleaned those hydrants and a lot of people do it.
But these applications are like digital reminder that we're not only consumers -- we're not just government consumers that we pay taxes and get services.
We're more than that, we're citizens.
And we're not going to fix government until we don't fix the city.
So I want to ask all the present, when it's about the important things that we have to do together, all together, we'll be a curve of voices, or will we be a multiply of hands?
Thank you.
This is for me a real honor.
I've spent most of the time in prison, prisons and the death run.
I've spent most of my life in marginalized communities, in projects and places where there are a lot of despair.
And being here at TED seeing and hearing these stimulus has given me a lot of energy.
One of the things I've noticed in this short time is that TED has identity.
And the things that are said here have impact around the world.
In occasion, if something comes from TED, it makes a sense and a force that wouldn't have otherwise.
I say this because I think identity is really important.
Here we have seen fantastic presentations.
And I think we've learned that the words of a teacher can make a lot of sense, but if they teach with feelings, they can have special meaning.
A doctor can do good things, but if it's cardiovascular, it can achieve much more.
So I want to talk about the power of identity.
I didn't actually learned this in the practice, my job.
I learned from my grandmother.
I grew up in a traditional house of an African-American family dominated by a marriage, which was my grandmother.
It was hard, it was strong, I had power.
It was the last word in all discussions in the family.
She started a lot of the discussions in our home.
It was a daughter of people who had been slaves.
His parents were born in slavery in Virginia over the 1850.
She was born over the 1880s and his experience with slavery as I saw the world.
She was hard, but it was also loving too.
When I was a little girl and I looked at her, she came up and gave me a good hug to me.
I was so lucky that I could barely breathe, and then I would blow up.
One or two hours later, I went back and looked at it, and he said, "Bright, still feel my arm?
And if I told him that no, I was going back and I said yes, I was left in peace.
He had this human quality that made you always wanting to be close to it.
The only problem is, I had 10 children.
My mother was the youngest of the 10.
In occasion, when I was going to spend a time with her, it wasn't easy to capture his time and attention.
My cousins were running everywhere.
I remember when I was eight or nine years old, I woke up one morning, I went to the room, and there were all my cousins running out.
My grandmother was on the other side of the room and looked at me.
At first, I thought it was a game.
And so he looked at it, and he was smiling, but she was very serious.
After 15 or 20 minutes, she stood up, he grabbed the room, he took me out of my hand, and he said, "Go on Britain. We are going to be convinced."
I remember this as if it was yesterday.
I'll never forget it.
He took me outside and said, "Bridge, I'll tell you something, but you can't tell you."
I said, "Okay, Mauro."
She said, "Now let me not do it." I said, "Sure."
Then I sat down, he looked at me and said, "I want you to know that I've been looking at you."
And I said, "I think you're special.
He said, "I think you can do whatever you want.
I'll never forget it.
Then he said, "I want you to promise three things, Breah."
I said, "Sure, Maude."
And he said, "The first thing I want you to promise me is you always want your mother."
Addict, "She is my daughter, and you have to promise that I will always take care of it."
As I loved my mom, I said, "Yes, Maude, that's what I will do."
Then he said, "The second thing I want you to promise me is that they'll always do the right thing even though the right thing is tough.
I thought about it, and I said, "Yes, Mom, I will do."
Then, finally he said, "The third thing I want you to promise me is that never drink alcohol."
I was nine years old, and I said, "Yes, Mom, that's what I will do."
I grew up in the field, in the rural South, I have a brother a year older and a sister a younger year.
When I was 14, 15, one day my brother came home with a six beer package -- I don't know where he did it, I would grab my sister and I went to the forest.
We just came up with the madness.
He took a beer submission, he offered my sister, she took a little bit and offered me to me.
I said, "No, no, no. It's okay. You go, but I'm not going to take beer.
My brother said, "Come on. Today we do it. And you always do the same thing as we do.
I already took something, your sister too. Take a beer.
I said, "No. I wouldn't feel good. You can follow.
Then my brother looked at me.
And he said, "What happens to you? It takes a brown."
I was charged by the look at it and said, "Oh, not to be you still thinking about the conversation with Maude."
I said, "But what are you talking about?
He said, "Mary tells all the grandchildren who are special.
I was dried.
I have to admit something to you.
I'll tell you something that probably shouldn't say.
I know this will be spread up.
But I am 52 years old, and I can admit that I've never taken a drop of alcohol.
I don't say this is a virtue. I say it for the power of identity.
When we create the right kind of identity, we say things to the others that they don't really see sense.
We can't get to do things that don't believe to be able to do.
I think my grandmother naturally believed that all his grandchildren were special.
My grandfather had been prisoners during the ban for the ban, my grandfather had been.
My uncle died of diseases related to alcohol.
And these were the things that we had, according to it, we had to engage with.
Now, trying to talk about our criminal justice system.
This country is now very different than what was about 40 years ago.
In 1972, there were 300,000 prisoners.
There are 2.3 million.
In America, we have the largest incarceration rate in the world.
We have seven million people in the local freedom.
And this massive incarceration, in my opinion, has fundamentally changed our world.
In poor communities or black communities, it is so defect, so much despair.
One in three black between 18 and 30 is in prison or conflict freedom.
In urban communities across the country, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Baltimore Washington, Washington, 60 to 60 percent of all color young color are in prison or conflict freedom.
Our system is not just distorted in front of race, it's also about poverty.
In this country we have a judicial system that makes you much better if you're rich and guilty than if you're poor and innocent.
It's not guilt but wealth that results the results.
And it looks like we feel very quiet.
The politics of fear and factory makes us believe that these are not problems of us.
We're decentralized.
I find it interesting.
We're looking at our work some very curious development.
In my state, in Alabama, as well as in other states, you provide you from rights forever if you have a criminal condition.
Right now in Alabama, 34 percent of the black male population has definitely lost the right to vote.
And if we project it over the next 10 years, the level of loss of rights will be as elevated as it was before they were going to take the law from the right to vote.
We have this awesome silence.
I represent children.
Many of my clients are very young.
America is the only country in the world where you feel like 13 years old to die in prison.
We have in this country prison for children, no possibility of coming out.
Right now, we're in the process of some literature.
The only country in the world.
I represent people in the corridor of death.
This death penalty is interesting.
In some sense we have taught us to think that the final question is, are people deserve to die for the credit?
A very sensitive question.
But you can think of another way about how we're in our identity.
There's another way to look at it, it's not about deciding whether people deserve to die for the crimes, but if we deserve to kill.
This is interesting.
death penalty in America is defined by mistake.
Out of every nine people who were executed -- one that is innocent that is extracting and liberated from the corridor of death.
One rate of error -- amazing. An innocent in nine.
This is interesting.
It would not be allowed to be allowed to fly airplanes if every nine they would disappear, you would have to be stressed.
But somehow we get out of the problem.
It's not our problem.
It's not our charge.
It's not our struggle.
I talk a lot about these things.
I talk about race and this issue of whether we need to kill.
It's interesting that in my classes with students about African-American history, I talk about slavery.
I talk to you about terrorism, the time it started at the end of the reconstruction and it lasted to Second World War.
We really don't know a lot about this.
But for black Americans in this country, it was a little bit defined by terror.
In many communities people were afraid to be linked.
They worried about being bombarded.
The threat of the terror was what they define their lives.
Now there are older people who come to me and tell me, "Mr. Stevenson, you tell talks -- makes speeches a speakers, you give people to stop saying that in our history we deal with terrorism, after 1931.
They ask me to say, "No. Say we grew up with that."
The era of the terror, obviously, with security and decades of racial supply and separation.
In this country we have a dynamic that we don't like to talk about our problems.
We don't like to talk about our story.
And that's why we haven't understood the meaning of what we historically have done.
All the time we collide with each other.
We constantly create tensions and conflict.
It costs us to talk about races, I think it's because we're not willing to engage with a process of truth and reconciliation.
In South Africa, people understood that they couldn't overcome racial segregation without a commitment to truth and reconciliation.
In Rwanda, even before the genocide had this commitment, but in this country we haven't done it.
I was in Germany giving lectures about death labor.
It was fascinating because one of the teachers stood after my presentation and said, "You know it's good worrying to hear what you say.
Addict, "We don't have death row in Germany.
We can never be able to have it here."
The room stayed in silence, and a lady said, "There is no way that with our history, we could never get into the systematic death of human beings.
It would be irrational that we us, intentional and deliberately -- we were going to run people."
You think about this.
How would we feel in a world where a nation like Germany, would run people, especially if they were mostly Jews?
We couldn't tolerate it.
It would be irrational.
And yet, there is this disconnect yet.
I think our identity is in danger.
If you don't really care about these very difficult issues, positive and wonderful things are, however, implicated.
We love innovation.
It fascinated us. We worship creativity.
We love entertainment.
But lately, those realities are increased by suffering, abuse, degradation, marketing.
In my opinion, you need to integrate both things.
And lately we talk about the need to have more hope, more engagement, more dedication with the basic challenges of this complex world.
I think that means spending more time thinking and talking about the poor, the shocked ones, which will never come to TED.
Think about them is, in a way, something that's inside our being.
It's true that we have to believe in issues that we haven't seen.
We are. Even though it's so rational, so committed to the intellectual thing.
With creativity, with creativity, development comes not just from brain ideas.
These things come from food ideas also by heart conditions.
This connection of mind with the heart is what drives us to look at not just brilliant and unusual but also dark and hard.
Vacation Hans, the great leader, talked about this.
He said, "When we were in East Europe suffering the oppression -- we had all kinds of things, but primarily what we needed was hope, orientation for spirit, a willingness to be in species of despair and being a test."
Well, that orientation for spirit is pretty much in the heart of what I believe, that even in communities like TED, it must be committed.
There is no disconnect to technology and design, which allows us to be truly human if we don't pay attention to poverty, to exclusion to inequality, to injustice.
Now I want to warn you that these thoughts make a much more challenging identity than if we ignore these things.
Let's go back to find them.
I had the great privilege being a very young lawyer to meet Rosa Parks.
These women get together just to speak.
Occasionally, Mr. racing called me, to say, "Bridge, come the Mrs. Parks. We're going to meet to speak.
Do you want to come and listen to it?
I said, "Be lady. I want you."
So she said, "Well, what do you do when you come from?"
I said, "Let's hear it."
So I went and just listened to them.
It was very virtual, very light.
And in one occasion, I was there, listening to these ladies, and after a couple of hours, Ms. Parks came to me and said, "Now Brian -- let me be that idea of equal justice.
Tell me what you're trying to do."
And I started giving my speech.
I said, "Well, we're trying to question injustice.
We try to help those who have been convicted on unfortunate.
We try to confront prejudice and discrimination in criminal justice.
We tried to end up with the sentences of life, without a government for children.
We try to do something about death penalty about it.
We try to reduce population in prisons.
We tried to end up with mass developments."
He gave him all my best speech, and he looked at me and he said, "It members moment?
And I said, "Let me be a short, very angry little shot."
At that time, Ms. Carol leaned up, put my finger in the face and said, "That's why you have to be very very bad."
I think the TED community has to be much more valuable.
We have to find a way to tackle those challenges, those problems, that suffering.
Because eventually humanity depends on compassion for others.
I've learned some very simple things in my work.
I've been educated in simple things.
I've come to understand and believe that every one of us is higher to the worst thing we've made.
I think that's true for everybody on the planet.
I'm convinced that if someone says a lie, it's not because it's a liar.
I'm sure if someone takes something that doesn't belong, it's not that it's a land.
Even if someone kills another, it's not that it's a killer.
So I think there's a basic dignity in the people that must be respected by law.
I also believe that in many parts of this country, and certainly in many parts of the world, the opposite of poverty is not wealth.
It's not.
I really think in many parts of poverty is justice.
And finally, I think that even though it's very dramatic -- very beautiful, very light, very stimulating, we will not judge for our technology, for our design, not by our intellectual or rational capacity.
The end is judge the character of a society, not the way they treat the rich and powerful and privilege, but the way they treat poor people, the conditions, the prisoners.
Because it's in this context as we start to understand truly profound issues about what we are.
I feel willing to be dramatically. I'm going to end with a story.
Sometimes I make too much force.
I was tired, like all.
Sometimes those ideas go beyond my reasoning in an important way.
I've been representing these kids who have been sentenced with a lot of death.
I go to prison and I see my 13-year-old customers and 14 years old, who have been taken to judge them as adults.
And I start thinking, how can it be?
How can a judge come to someone in what isn't it?
The judge took it as an adult, but I see a child.
One night I was very late -- I was thinking about -- by God, if the judge can become something that you're not, it must have magical powers.
Yes, Brian, the judge has magic powers.
You should ask for something about that.
As it was too late, I couldn't think properly, but I started working on a motivation.
I had a 14 year-old customer, a little, poor, black.
I started working on the money, with an encouraging that he said, "Mind for my 14-year-old black customer to be treated as a 75-year-old privileged white white white white white.
In the location I put that there had been a behavior in the action, in the behavior of police and in the process.
There was an additional line about how in this country there is no ethics but a whole lack of ethics.
On the next morning, I woke up thinking that motivation would be a dream, or actually wrote it?
For my horror, not only had he cut it down, but he had sent it to the court.
About two months, I had forgotten it.
And I finally decided -- "Oh God, I have to go to the cut for this stupid case.
I got to the car and I felt truly observered, overwhelmed.
I went into the car to court.
I thought this would be very difficult and perfect.
I finally got out of the car. I walked to court.
I was climbing the stairs when I found a senior black man -- he was the contract of the judgment.
When he saw me, he came up to me and said, "Who is you?"
I said, "I'm an atomize." He said, "Is you attribute? I said yes.
So I came up to me and hug me.
And I was whispering in the ear.
He said, "I'm proud of you."
I have to tell you now that that was strange.
That was deeply connected with my interior, with my identity with the ability that we all have to contribute to the community with a hope.
Well, I went into the audience room.
In the inside, the judge saw me.
He said, "Mr. Stevenson, you wrote this short more more money?
I said, "Yes, Mr. I was me." And we started discussing it.
People started coming. They were all indigenous.
I was the one who had written those crazy.
The cops came out of the personal fishermen, the automobiles.
Suddenly, without knowing how, the living room was full of people -- all of us failed because we talked about race, because we talked about poverty, because we talked about inequality.
With the radiation of the eye he went to see the contact he was going and came.
He looked at the window and he was encouraged to hear all that scream.
I kept walking around and there.
Finally, this old black old, with a concern face, walked into the room and sat behind me, almost at the table of lawyers.
About 10 minutes later, the judge gave a recession.
During the break, a assistant of the algae was shown by operational because he had entered the room.
The assistant was released on the old black.
And he said, "Jim, what do you do in the audience?
And the old black stood on foot, looked at the antibiotic, he looked at me and said, "I've got this audience room to tell this young man who kept his view on the goal with screen."
I've come today to TED because I think many of you understand that the moral arc of the universe is very large, but it folds towards justice.
That we cannot really be truly evolved if we don't worry about human rights and by dignity.
That our survival is tied to each other.
That our visionary visions of technology, design, entertainment and creativity should lead to the from the freedom of companies, compassion and justice.
And above all, to those of the people who share this, I just want to tell you that you keep the view on the goal with screen.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: You just heard and see an obvious desire of the audience, from this community, to help in your purposes of doing something.
Something that's not a cheese. What can we do?
BJ: There are several opportunities close to it.
If you live in the state of California, for example, there will be a referendum this spring in which you will make an effort to reorganize the funds that are spending today in punishment policy.
For example, here in California, you're going to spend a billion dollars in death penalty in the next five years. A billion dollars.
And despite this, 46 percent of the cases of homeless don't fit in arms.
56 percent of the rapes don't get anything.
Here's an opportunity of change.
This referendum is going to propose that these funds are destroyed to make it turn to the law, to safety.
I think there's a very close opportunity.
CA: There has been a huge decline in crime in the United States, in the last three decades.
Part of the explanation, you say it has to do with the biggest incarceration rate.
What would you say to the ones that you think is this?
BJ: Actually, the rate of crime with violence has remained relatively stable.
The great growth in mass incarceration in this country is not for the violence.
It's the wrong equivalent against drugs.
That's why this dramatic increase comes up in the prison population.
And we let us convince the rhetoric of the punishment.
We have three legal causes to bring people to a perpetual chain, to steal a bicycle, by small crimes against property, rather than getting those resources to their victims.
I think we have to do more to help victims of crime and not less.
It seems to me that our current philosophy about punishment is nothing for anyone.
I think that's the orientation that has to change.
CA: Brian, you have been excited about it today.
You're very inspiring.
Thank you very much for having come to TED. Thank you.

Peter Diamonds: These are just some of the clips that I got in the last six months, allowed to be in the last six days or over the last six years.
The idea is that press means prefer to give us negative news, because our minds pay attention.
And that responds to a very good reason.
In every second of each day, our senses get a lot more data than probably the brain can process.
And as nothing care more than survive, the first side of all of those data is an old fragment of the temporal lobe called an analogy.
The amygdala is our early warning detector -- the danger detector.
I ordered and record all the information looking for something in the environment that could make us harm.
So for a dozen stories we will prefer to look at negative.
That old thing about the press, "If there is blood blood, sell, it's very true.
And because all digital devices give us negative news the seven days of the week, 24 hours a day, not to miss that we are psychiatric.
It's not surprising that people think the world is going to be wrong.
But maybe it's not.
Maybe what happens is that we got distributions.
Perhaps the huge progress done in the last century for a series of forces is accelerating. We have the potential to create a world of abundance in the next three decades.
I'm not saying we don't have our good problems, climate change, species extinction and water scarcity and energy -- certainly we have them.
As human beings are very good at embracing the problems and at the long time, we ended up with them.
We analyzed it in the last century to see where we go.
In the last hundred years, the average life is more than doubled, average per capita income per capita has been tripled around the world.
Child mortality has been reduced 10 times.
Also, the cost of food, from electricity, transportation and communications has fallen from 10 to 1,000 times.
Steve Pink showed us that we're living the most peaceful time in human history.
And Charles Kenya that global literacy went from 25 percent to more than 80 percent in the last 130 years.
We're actually living an extraordinary time.
A lot of people forget it.
And we continue to put more and higher expectations.
In fact, we redefined the meaning of poverty.
Think about it, today in America, much of the people who live under the poverty line have electricity, water, toilets, neighborhoods, television, mobile air and cars.
The magnetic magnets of the past century, the entrepreneurs of the planet, would never have dreamed with such luxury.
To support a lot of this is technology and, ultimately, its exponential growth.
My good friend Ray Kurzweil showed that any tool that comes up in information technology jumps in this curve, Moore's Law, and doubled the price performance in about 12 to 24 months.
So the mobile phone that you have in the pocket is a million times cheaper and a thousand times faster than a superconduction in the 1970s.
Now look at this curve.
It's Moore's Law for the last hundred years.
I want you to look at two things in this curve.
First, how soft it is, good and bad times, in war and peace, in recession and depression and strangers.
It's the quick computer outcome used to build faster.
It doesn't stop before any big challenges.
And even though it's programmed in a law on the left, it curve goes up.
The growth rate of technology is more and faster.
And in this curve, in the rockets of Moore's Law, there is a series of extraordinarily powerful technologies that we tell today.
The computer in the cloud, that my Austrian friends call infinite computing computing and sensors and networks, 3D printing and their ability to democratize and distribute personalized production across the planet, synthetic biology, fuels and vaccines and food, digital medicine, natural and A.I.
I mean, how many saw the victory in Jesus of Watson, from IBM from IBM?
It was piece.
I looked at the newspapers the best headline that I had.
And I loved this one: "With "With Venticefied Venes Venes?
"Jeopardy" is not an easy game.
It plays with the songs of the human language.
Imagine this artificial intelligence in the cloud, available to everyone on the phone.
Four years ago, here at TED, Ray Kurzweil and I, we launched a new university called Silicon University.
We teach these technologies to our students, and in particular, how they can use to solve the big challenges of humanity.
And every year we ask them to launch a company, or a product or service, that can potentially affect the lives of a billion people in a decade.
Think about that, the fact that a group of students today can impact the life of a billion people.
Thirty years ago, that would have been absurd.
Today we can point out a dozen companies that have already done it.
When I think about creating abundance, it doesn't mean creating fancy life for every single person on the planet, it's about creating a life of possible.
It's about taking that that is scarce, and it is going to make it almost.
You see, scarcity is contextual and technology is a force that releases resources.
Let me give you an example.
It's a story of Nagoo II in the middle of the 1800s.
He's the guy on the left.
I invited the king of Simonia.
The transparency troops ate with silver covers, and the same Native, with gold.
But the king of System, ate with aluminum covers.
You see, the aluminum was the most valuable metal on the planet, more than the gold and the dish.
And for that reason, the tip of the monument to Washington is almost.
You see, even though aluminum is 3,000 percent of the mass of the Earth, it doesn't come as a pure metal.
It's bound by oxygen and the synapses.
But then the electronics came and made the aluminum something so cheap that we use it as if it was decline.
We project this analogy to the future.
Think about energy scarcity.
Ladies and gentlemen, we're on a planet based on 5,000 times more energy than we use in a year.
They get to Earth 16 energy terabytes every 18 minutes.
It's not about scary, but accessible.
And there are good news.
This year, for the first time, the cost of solar energy in India is 50 percent less than the people in India -- 8,000 rupees versus 17 rupees.
The cost of solar energy fell 50 percent last year.
Last month, MIT published a study that shows that at the end of the decade, in the sunny parts of the United States, solar electricity will cost six cents a hour per hour compared to the 15 cents.
And if we have energy abundance we also have water abundance too.
Let's talk now about the wars for water.
Remember when Carl Sagan pointed out the Voyager Space spacecraft, in 1990, after Saturn.
It took a famous picture. How was it called it?
"A pale blue dot place?
Because we live on a water planet.
We live on a planet covered by 70 percent per water.
Yes, the 97 percent is saltwater, the two percent is ice, and we fight for a hundred percent of the water on the planet, but there is a hope.
It's a technology available not in 10 or 20 years, but right now.
Narrative comes, the narratives.
In a conversation with Dean Kamen this morning, one of the properties of the school innovators -- I'd like to share with you, I gave me permission to do -- his technology called Solarmance -- you know, you know that -- it's the size of a small refrigerator.
It's able to generate a thousand liters of drinking water into any source -- water water, contaminated water, a latrine.
The president of Coke just agreed to do an important test of hundreds of these units in the developing world.
If that comes well, and I have full confidence that this is going to be, Coke will implement it globally in 60 countries on the planet.
This is an innovation that is connected by this technology that is today.
And we've seen it in mobile phones.
Oh my God, we're going to get to 70 percent penetration of mobile phones in the developing world for the late 2013.
Think about it, that mass warrior has better mobile communications in the middle of Kenya than President Reagan 25 years ago.
And, of course, with a smartphone with Google, it has access to more knowledge and information than President Clinton 15 years ago.
It lives in a world of information abundance and communications that nobody could ever have predicted.
Better than that, the things that you and I have paid dozens and hundreds of thousands of GPS dollars, HIV video, images, books and music, technology technology -- now they deliver and lose market value with mobile phones.
Maybe the best thing is when the health applications are.
Last month, I had the pleasure to announce with the Muslim Foundation something called the X Zuman Culty Trackin, 10 million dollars.
We're challenging the teams in the world to combine these technologies in a mobile device that they talk about, and because it has A.I. can take, they can take blood from the finger.
To win it has to make better diagnosis.
Imagine this device in the middle of the developing world where there are no doctors, where the mortality burden is 25 percent, and there are 100 percent health workers.
When this device sequence a virus of RNA or DNA that doesn't recognize -- calling the health of health, and first of all, avoiding that pandemic happened.
But this is the biggest force to produce a world of abundance.
I call it the billion at the time.
The white lines here are the population.
We just went through the seven billion brand.
By the way, the best protection against demographic explosion is to empower the world of education and health.
In 2010, we had less than two billion people online, connected.
By 2020, it'll go from two billion to five billion internet users.
Three billion minds never heard before the global conversation.
What would these people want?
What do you do? What do you want to do?
And instead of an economic collapse, we will have the largest economic injection of history.
These people represent tens of billions of dollars injected in the global economy.
And they will make care of the Trianger because of the Triangle, a better education with the Academy Khan and because of the use of 3D printing and computing in the cloud will be more productive than ever before.
What can we provide three billion more members of mankind, polite health and productive members."
How about some voices never before hate?
What if we give the operations, wherever they are, a voice to be heard and power for the first time?
What will these three billion do?
And what if they are contributions that we can't predict?
One thing that I learned with the X Prize is that small teams -- guided by their passion with a clear goal, can do extraordinary things, things that before only could make great corporations and governments.
I'm going to end up sharing a story that really excites me.
There's a program that maybe some of you know.
It's called Florida.
It came up at the University of Washington, in Seattle.
It's a game where people can take a sequence of amino amino and figure out how protein will be.
Players determine structure and function.
It's very important in medical research.
And so far, it was a problem of supercomputer.
They've played with this college teacher, among others.
And then hundreds of thousands of people were joining and started playing it.
And it has been shown that the human pattern recognition machinery is better folding proteins than the best computers.
Ladies and gentlemen, what gives me a huge trust in the future is that today we have more power as people to take the big challenges on the planet.
We have the tools with this exponential technology.
We have the passion of the progress of the prize.
We have the capital of the technology.
And we have three billion new minds that will be used to work in the solution of big challenges and do what we should do.
We have some extraordinary decades.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about a very small idea.
This is the corruption of the starting point.
And as the idea can be explained in a minute, before I'll give you three examples to do time.
The first story is Charles Darwin, one of my heroes.
He was here, as you know, in 1838.
You might believe that it would be painful, but it wasn't like that.
It actually collects fish.
And he described one of them as very common."
It was the fear.
I caught it up to the 1880s.
Now the fish is on the Red League of CAR.
But we've heard this story many times, about Galapagos and other places, so that has nothing special.
But the case is we still come to Galapagos.
We still think they're president.
The pollen still says they follow intact.
So what happens here?
The second story, also illustrates another concept -- the disappearing of the waist.
Because I was there in 1974, studying a language in West Africa.
I was there because I grew up in Europe, and then I wanted to work in Africa.
I thought I could get in.
I burned a lot with the sun and I was convinced that I wasn't there.
This is my first exposure to the sun.
The language was surrounded by walls, and as you can see, from a few mangroves.
There were the telephones of about 20 centimeters -- black barrier.
And the fish of this thylacine was very abundant and happened for a good moment, so it was more than the middle in Ghana.
When I went there 27 years later, the amount of fish had fallen in half.
They made the five centimeters.
They experienced a genetic pressure.
There were still fish.
In a way, they were still happy.
And the fish were still happy to be there.
I mean, nothing to change, but everything has changed.
My third story is that I was comparable in the introduction of the drag fishing in Southeast Asia.
In the 1970s -- well, it started in 1960 -- Europe did a lot of developing projects.
The fishing development knew to impose countries that were already 100,000 fishermen to impose industrial fishing.
And this boat, pretty ugly, was called the Museum Four.
I went out to fish in him, and we did studies in South China in the Marine Sea, and especially in the Garden Sea.
What we captured was something inequality.
Capture now, the bottom of the sea.
Ninety percent of what we captured were spiritually, other animals that are in the background.
And most fish are tiny spots about the rest of them, remains of coral reef fish.
In short, the bottom of the sea came to the cover and then thrown out.
These images are extraordinary, because transition is very quick.
In a year, you do a study and then start commercial fishing.
The background is going to be a solid corner of coral culture, in this case, to be a stunt.
This is a dead tourist.
They didn't eat them. They found them because they were dead.
Once we captured a living.
I was still not removed.
So they wanted to kill it because it was a good food.
This mountain of remains is what the fishermen collect every time they go to an area where they never fish.
But it's not documented.
We transform the world, but we don't remember it.
We adjust the game point, to the new level, without remembering what was there.
If we generalize this something like this.
On the axis -- and we have good things -- biodiversity -- lots of origins, the verb of the country, the water supply.
And that changes over time. It changes because people do things with nature.
Each generation will use the images of the image of their conscious life as normal as the normal and extract it forward.
The difference is that they perceive the loss.
But they don't perceive the loss that happened before.
You can analyze the cost of change.
And at the end of the stage to keep some of the rest.
And that, in big extent, is we want to do it now.
We want to keep things that are no longer what they were.
But you should think that this problem affects people when predatory societies kill animals without knowing what they've done to generations later.
Because, obviously, an animal that is very abundant -- before you go extinct -- it's very strange.
You don't lose abundant animals.
You lose little animals.
Even if this is not perceived as a big loss.
Over time, we focus on big animals and in a signal of big fish.
They become unusual because we fish them.
And over time, there are a few fish, but we think that's the starting point.
And the question is, why do we accept this?
Well, because we don't know it was different.
In fact, many people, scientists, questioning that it was very different.
And you will do it because the evidence presented in an earlier way is not the way they expect to have evidence.
For example, the anecdote that some of you are presenting -- like capable of capable of it, and such a lot of fish in this area can't be used or usually not use the scientists of fishing because it's not scientist."
So we have a situation where people don't know the past, even though we live in instinctive societies, because they don't trust the sources of the past.
From there the huge role that can take a marine area.
Because with the protected marine areas, we really record the past.
We recreate the past that people can't conceive because the starting point has been running and it's absolutely low.
That's for the people that you can see a marine area protected and can benefit from the vision that allows them to erase their starting point.
And what about people who can't do it because they don't have access, like people in the Middle East, for example?
I think there are the arts and the cinema maybe can fill the vacuum. The simulation.
This is a simulation of the Charles Bay.
A long time ago, there were gray whales in the Charles Bay 500 years ago.
And you'll have noticed that the killing and the skills are like "advance."
And if you think about Adam, if you think about why people meet the movie -- not talking about the story of Policians -- why do you engage with the imagery.
Because it comes up with something that in a sense, in a sense, have been lost.
So my recommendation -- the only one I'm going to give, is Cambodia, to "advantage II under the water.
Thank you very much.
Hi. I'm Kevin Alfram, the YouTube trend manager -- and I look at YouTube videos in a professional way.
It's true.
So today we're going to see why videos get viral and how important that is.
We all want to be stars, celebration, singers, comedian -- when I was younger, that seemed very, very hard.
But today the web video makes any of us, or our actions -- is a story in a part of our global culture.
Anybody can be famous on the Internet in a sand.
It's over 48 hours of video to YouTube per minute.
And, of course, only a little percentage makes it viral -- it gets infinite vision and crazy multimedia.
How does that happen?
Three things: trend creators, participation communities and surprise.
Well, let's start.
Beau Vagina, "Oh my God, my God.
Oh my God!
Wow.
Walkgowan, guy.
KA: Last year, Ben Velgry published this video outside of his house in the Yosemite National Park.
In 2010, it was 23 million times.
This graph shows the reproduction.
Bees can't make a viral video.
I just wanted to share a double rainbow.
That's what you do if it's called YouTube Mountain Bees.
I had already published many videos of nature.
This video had been published in January.
So what happened here?
It was Jimmy Kimon.
Jimmy Kimmeng published this test that would catch the video to popularity video.
The trends of trends like Jimmy Kim presents us new things and interesting things and divorce them to a wider audience.
Rebel Black,"  It's Friday, Vietnam. You have to start Friday --   Everybody wants to get the weekend on the weekend --   Verositists, Friday, starting Friday --  KA: You won't think that we can have this conversation without talking about this video, I hope.
View Black Blood is one of the most popular videos of the year.
They saw it almost 200 million times this year.
This graph shows the frequency of use.
Like "Dry Radio Duke," this video seemed to have come out of nothing.
So what happened this day?
Well, it was Friday, it's true.
And if you ask for those other peaks are also Vietnam.
But what happened this day, this particular Friday on particular?
Well, I took it and many blogs started writing about it.
Michael J. Nelson, from Martin Science Theodor, was one of the first people to make a joke on the video on Twitter.
But the important thing is that one person or a group of trends of trends would adopt a point of view and share it with a broader public public, accelerating the process.
So, this community of people who share this big internal joke then starts talking about that and doing things.
And now there are 10,000 parody "Powers on YouTube.
Just in the first seven days, there was a parody for each other day.
Unlike the original entertainment of the 20th century, this community participation is our way to be part of the phenomenon -- by making it something new with that.
"The Cataly Catar" is a repeat animation with a record music.
It's like this, that's it.
This year you saw about 50 million times.
And if you think that's weird, you know that there is a three hours version that you see four million times.
Until the cats saw this video.
And there are cats that saw other cats to see the video.
But the important thing here is the creativity that woke up between the Internet technology community.
There were remote.
Somebody made a version of the old one.
And then it became international.
Suddenly, it was a whole community of refugee that made this happen from being a stupid joke to something that we all can make part.
Because today we don't just enjoy -- we participate it.
Who could have predicted something like this?
Who might have predicted "Radio Radio Duke or Rebel Black or Nanokau Cattle?
What did you have written to have written that situation?
In a world where you get two days of video per minute, only that really unique and unexpected can get away from the way that these things have done it.
When a friend told me that I had to look at this big video of a guy who protests against the multi-footprint collapses in New York, I admit that I didn't really get too interested in it.
Casey Singapore: I was moved by no circular for biomass, but there are often obstacles that are prevented by the circulation of the biomass.
KA: Thank you the surprise effect and your humor, Casey Linux made five million people see and understand their idea.
So this approach is worth the whole new thing we do in creative ways.
And all of this leads to a big question.
Beethoven Vagina, what does this mean?
Oh Whirrin.
KA: What does this mean?
The trend creators of participation, creative communities of participation, are totally unexpected of a new type of media, of a new culture, to which we all have access to it, and it's the audience that defines popularity defines the audience.
As I said before, one of the world's current celebrities -- Justin Bible, started in YouTube.
They don't ask permission to express their ideas.
Now we're all a little bit owners of our pop culture.
These are not the characteristics of old media -- it's just the current media, but define the entertainment of the future.
Thank you.
This is not a finished story.
It's a puzzle that's still bombing.
Let me tell you about some of the pieces.
Imagine the first piece, a man burning the work of a life.
It's a poet, a playwright, a man whose entire life had supported in the unique hope of the unit and freedom of his country.
Think about it as the communities come into Santa, facing the fact that their life had been totally in vain.
The words, for so long friends, now was undergoing it.
It was recorded in silence.
He died by history.
He's my grandfather.
I never met it.
But our lives are much more than our memories.
My grandmother never allowed me to forget his story.
My task was not to let me have been in vain. And my lesson was to learn that the story tried to speak to us, but we stand up.
The next part of the puzzle is about a boat when you threaten slightly delivered to sea.
My mother, Mai, was just 18 years old when her father died, and a concentrated marriage and two little girls.
For her, life had been destined to a job silly, the escape of her family and a new life in Australia.
It was unusual for her that I couldn't do it.
And after a four years of a face that defies fiction, a boat went down into the disguised sea of fishing bureaucration.
All adults knew the risks.
The biggest fear were the pirate and rape and death.
Like most adults, my mother took a sentence with poison.
If we were caught out, first we would take my sister and I, and then she and my grandmother.
My first memories are from that boat, the control rate of the engine, the ground standing in every wave, and the vast and empty horizon.
I didn't remember the pirate pieces that came several times, but they were linked to the value of men in our boat, or the engine dying and not being able to run for six hours.
But I remember the lights of the oil platform in front of the coast of Malaysia, and the young man who collapsed and died, finish the journey was too much for him, and the first apple I tried to give up the model of the platform.
No apple had the same taste.
After three months in a refugee camp, we developed in Melinejabac.
And the next piece of the puzzle is about four women over three generations of a new life together.
We set up in Forester, a class suburbs who are compared to immigrants.
Unlike the middle class suburbs -- whose existence I knew, in Fouriec, didn't feel the right.
The smells that come from the shops were the rest of the world.
And the fragments of the entrepreneurial English were engaged among the people who had one thing in common: they were starting again.
My mother worked in farms, then on a car mountain, working six days, double turn.
Yet, I found time to study English and get a title on IT -- technology of information.
We were poor.
All the dollars were assigned and established an extra tutor in English and mathematics, no matter what you should take out, which generally was new clothes, always a second hand.
Two media pairs for school, one to hide the holes of the other.
A school uniform to the tolerance, because I had to last six years.
And there were weird singing and painful singers on the sad eyes and some graffiti "shared, "samples: "They go home."
At home, Where?
Something in me was founded.
He was accumulating determination and a voice that said, "I'm going to support you."
My mother, my sister and I slept in the same bed.
My mother was extended every night, but we told us about our day and we heard the movements of our grandmother's home.
My mother suffered displayed, all of the boat.
And my task was to be awake until his nightmares would start to be able to shoot it.
She opened up a computer store, then I studied to be stability and opened another business.
And women came with their stories about men who couldn't do the transition -- angry, inflationary and infant kids trapped between two worlds.
Supply and sponsors.
And they created centers.
I lived in parallel worlds.
In one, it was the classic Asian student, relentless with what they demand.
In the other, I was buried in private lives, translated by violence, drug abuse and isolation.
But many received help over the years.
And for that work, when I studied my last year of lawyer, I was elected the year Australian of the year.
And I was captured from one piece of puzzle to the other, but his edges didn't fit up.
So read, anti-collar anti-collar resistance, it was now as Lee, refugee and social activist invited to speak in places I had never heard of, and at home whose existence she would never have imagined.
I didn't know the protocols.
I didn't know how to use the covers.
I didn't know how to talk about wine.
I didn't know how to talk about anything.
I wanted to go back to the routine and the configuration of life in an impossible suburb -- a grandmother, a mother and two daughters finishing the day as they did for almost 20 years, telling about the day of each and every single and getting asleep, the three still in the same bed.
And I told my mom that I couldn't do it.
He reminded me that I had now the same age that she had when we went back to the boat.
The not ever had been an option.
"Do it, he said, "And you're not what you don't.
So I talked about youth disability and education and destruction to the marginalized and the protester.
And the more frankly I talked about, the more it was the more to speak.
I met people from all walks of life, many of them doing what they love, living on the border of possible.
And although I finished my license, I realized I couldn't stay in a car race.
There had to be another piece of the puzzle.
And I realized at the same time that it's okay to be a disconnected, a newly new one, new at the scene -- and not just that it's good, but it's something that will be grateful, maybe a gift of the boat.
Because being inside it can easily mean collaborating the horizon, it can easily mean accept the assumptions of your province ...
I gave the enough steps outside my comfort zone to know that, yeah, the world is devoted, but not the way we fear.
possibilities that were not allowed to be allowed to be allowed to be all encouraged tremendously.
There was an energy there, an implanted optimism, a rare mixture of humility and value.
So I followed my intuition.
And together to a small group of people for whom the motto can't do -- it was an irresponsible challenge.
For a year we didn't have a cents.
At the end of every day, I made a giant line of soup that we all share.
We worked on the night at night.
Most of our ideas were crazy, but some brilliant ones, and we open up step.
I made the decision to move to the United States.
After one journey.
My heart again.
Three months later, I had moved down, and the adventure continued.
Before I finish, let me tell you about my grandmother.
She grew up in a time where the confusion was the social norm and the local Mandarin was the person who cared about.
Life had not changed for centuries.
His father died shortly after she was born.
The mother grew up.
At the age of 17, it became a connection of a Mandarin whose mother was hitting it.
No support of his husband, causes a revolution to demand it and take the cause herself and much more revolutionary causes when he won.
You can't do it to be wrong.
I was in the shower in the fourth of a hotel in Sydney when she died, 3,000 miles, in Mellony.
I looked through the shower of the shower and I saw it standing on the other side.
I knew I had come to describe.
My mother called minutes later.
Days later, we went to a Buddhist temple in Fouriectles, and we sat around their attack.
We told stories and we made sure that we were still with it.
At night, a man came up and told us that he had to close the attack.
My mother asked us to feel his hand.
I asked the monkey, "Why is your hand hot, and the rest of the body so cold?
"Because you've taken your hand from the morning, he said.
"You haven't satured it."
If there's a nerve in our family, that run through women.
Because we were and how life formed us, we can now see that the men who had reached our lives would have frustrated us.
The defeat would have made it easily.
Now I want to have my own kids, and I wonder about the boat.
Who could wish that for you?
However, I fear the privilege of the easy, the right.
Can I give you a product in your lives, dip it brave in every wave, the continuous pace of the engine, the vast horizon that doesn't guarantee anything?
I don't know.
But if I could do it and look at them, I would do.
Trade Nelson, and also the mother of this is today today, in the fourth or fifth line.
My story starts in Ratahors about two years ago.
I was in the desert, under the street sky, with the Sufi Star Alex.
We were having a conversation of how nothing has changed from the time of ancient Indian epidemic "The Mahatma."
In those days when the Indians wanted to travel we went to a car, and we took the sky.
Now we do it with airplanes.
At that time when I Andrew, the big Indian pressure -- he had smell, he took a bow and with a floor on the ground, it got water.
We now do the same with pills and machines.
The conclusion we took was that the machinery had replaced magic.
And that was a lot of fun.
I felt a little bit more technological.
I was terrified by this idea of losing the ability to enjoy and appreciate a confidence if I didn't have the camera, if I couldn't touch my friends.
It seemed to me that technology had to allow the magic, not kill it.
As a child, my grandfather gave me his player plane of pocket.
And this technology piece of 50 years was for my most magical thing.
It became a golden door to a world full of images, of pirate and narratives in my imagination.
I had the feeling that mobile phones, the luxury clocks and the cameras prevent us to be.
They hold our inspiration.
And so I launched me, I was thrown into this technological world to see how to create magic rather than killing it.
I illustrate books since the age of 16.
So when I saw the iPad, I saw a narrative device capable of connecting to the readers of the entire world.
You can know how we take the book.
Where we are.
It will bring the text with the image, the animation and sound and touch.
Narrative becomes increasingly multinational.
But what does that serve us?
I'm about to launch Khan, an interactive application for iPad.
He says, "I put your fingers on every light."
And so --   says, "This box belongs to -- I write my name.
And so I become a character of the book.
At several times I got a card -- the iPod knows where I live thanks to GPS -- that comes to me.
My inner girl are excited about all of these possibilities.
I've talked a lot about magic.
And I don't mean magic and dragons, but to that magic of childhood, to those ideas we open from children.
For some reason, fireflies in a jar were always exciting to me.
So over here, we have to tilt the iPad.
And, really, you light your way back in the back of the book.
Another idea that I was fascinated by a girl was that a whole galaxy comes in a ball.
So here, every book and every world is transformed into a ball that I drag towards this magic device, inside of the device.
And this opens up a map.
In every fantasy book there has always been maps, but they've been static maps.
This is a map that grows and flows and guide you during the rest of the book.
At some point in the book it is also revealed.
Now I'm going to go in.
Another hugely important aspect for me is to create Indian content and a contemporary time.
These are the shows here.
We've all heard of the standards and the media, but how many people outside India know their Indian contracts, would they stop them?
These poor people have been trapped in the cameras of Indra for millennia, in an old and fear book.
So we're bringing them back into a contemporary child history.
In a story that deals with current issues like the environmental crisis.
And talking about the environmental crisis, one of the problems of the last 10 years has been that kids have been locked up, stuck to their PCS, have not come out to the outside world.
But now with mobile technology, we can take our kids to the natural world with their technology.
One of the interactions of the book is this adventure where you have to go out into the outside, take the camera or iPad, and collect images of different natural objects.
As a child, I had a lot of collections: stories, stones, warriors and coast.
For some reason, kids don't do it.
So to reclaim this little childhood ritual you have to go out and in a chapter, take a picture of a flower and then label it.
In another chapter, you have to take a picture of a piece of cortex and then label it.
So you create a digital collection of pictures that then you can put it on the Web.
A boy in London puts a picture of a run and says, "Oh, I saw a short."
A child in India says, "I saw a monkey."
And it creates this kind of social network around a collection of digital photos that have been taken out.
Within the connections of the connection between magic, Earth and technology are many possibilities.
In the next book, we found out to have an interaction where you come out with the iPad, and the video concentrated and through augmented reality sees a group of animal people that appear about the indoor plants of the house.
At a moment, the screen is full of leaves.
You have to make the sound of the wind and blow them up so you can read the rest of the book.
We go to a world where the forces of nature are intertwined with technology and magic and technology are closer to each other.
We leverage the energy of the sun.
We're approaching our children and ourselves to the natural world and to that magic and joy and child love that we felt through a simple story.
Thank you.
I would like to talk to you about why a lot of people fail.
And I think, really, that the most important thing about that is that we stop listening to patients.
And one of the things we did at the Republic University was to trigger a director of listening.
And not in a very scientific way, she ran a little coffee cup or you and I asked patients, family and known, what happens?
"How can we help it?
And we tend to think, this is one of the biggest problems for what everybody is, or maybe not all, but most of the sensitivity projects fail, because we stopped listening.
This is my Wikipedia scale. It's a very simple thing.
It has a piece of concentration and shot off.
Every morning I get stuck.
And yes, I have a challenge as you can see.
I got the challenge to get to 95 kilograms here.
But it's so simple, that every time I connect me, I sent my information to Google Health.
And my head doctor has access to him as well. So he can see what my weight problem is, not at the same time that it needs cardiograft or some urgency of that style but look back.
But there's another thing.
As some of you know, I have more than 4,000 followers on Twitter.
So every morning I connect my Wi-Fi school and before I go up to my car, people start talking to me, Lucaus, today I think you need a light lunch.
That's the best thing that can happen, because it's pressure of the pairs used to help patients, because it could be used for obesity, and also for patients to stop smoking.
On the other hand, it can be used to move people out of their chair, and together develop some recreational activity to have more control of their health.
From the next week being available.
This little barbaria connected to an iPhone or another device.
And people can, from their homes, take their blood pressure, send it to their doctor, and share it with others, for example, for 100 dollars.
This is the point where patients assume a position, they will recover control and to be captain of their own boat, but it can also help us with health care because of the challenges that we face, like the firing of the cost of medical attention, the doubling of demand and other issues.
To do techniques that are simple to use and start with this to engage patients in the team.
And they can do it with techniques like this, but also by critical.
And one of the things we did would like to share it with you with a video.
We all have navigation control in cars.
Maybe we even have them in our phones.
We know perfectly where the automatic box is in Mathematical cards.
It's also where all the gasoline are.
And of course, we can find fast food chains.
But where is the nearest DNA to help this patient?
We asked ourselves, but nobody did.
Nobody knew where to get DAM saving lives right now.
What we did was we made core in the Netherlands.
We created a website, and we asked the audience to say, you see a DARPA, please look at it, you give me where it is and when it's open, since sometimes open in office hours and others are closed.
And over 10,000 DARS already presented in the Netherlands.
The next step was to look for the app for that.
And we made an app for iPad.
We created an app to Lama, augmented reality, to find these DARPA.
And every time you're in the city of Mathemate and someone collapse. They can use your iPhone, and next weeks to use their Microsoft cell cell to find the nearest DNA, what can save lives.
And from today, I would like to introduce this one, not just as David Steve, which is the name of the product, but also like DNA.
And we want to start at the world level.
We're building all the colleagues in the world, in other universities, to help us find, work and act as a center for the DVDs currently around the world.
Every time you're from vacation and somebody collapsed, it can be a relative or someone in front of you, you can find it.
I also wanted to invite companies around the world that could help us value these DATS.
They could be memory service or phone people, for example, to see if the DARPA that's shown is still in its place.
Please give us in this and not only improve health, but take control of it.
Thank you very much.
I'm here to share my photograph.
Or is it the photography?
Because, of course, they're pictures that can't take their cameras.
My interest for photography was woke up with my first digital camera at age 15 years.
He mixed up with my previous passion for the drawing, but it was a little bit different because when I used the camera the process was in planning.
And when you take a photograph with a camera the process ends up when you press the paradox.
For me, photography had more to be in the right place, at the right time.
I thought anybody could do it.
So I wanted to create something different, a process that would start by pressing the pulse.
Photographs like this: a building in a very transparent road.
But it has an unexpected turn.
And, despite that, it keeps a level of realists.
Or pictures like these -- dark and colorful at the time, but with the common goal of keeping the level of realists.
And when I say realism I say photographers.
Because, of course, it's not something that can capture but I always want it to seem to have been captured in some way as a photograph.
Photographs where you have to think about a moment to discover the trick.
It has more to do with capturing an idea that will capture a moment.
But what is the trick that makes them look like real?
Is it the details or the colors?
Did you intervene light?
What does the illusion do?
Sometimes illusion is perspective.
But at the end it's about our way to interpret the world and how you can perceive in a two-dimensional surface.
It's not really about whether it's realistic but what we think is realistic.
So I think the foundations are very simple.
I see it as a puzzle of the reality where we take different pieces of reality and put them together to create an alternative reality.
Let me show you a simple example.
So here we have three perfectly imagined objects, something that we can all relate to the three-dimensional world.
But combined in a certain way can create something that still seems three-dimensional as if it existed.
But at the same time, we know it doesn't exist.
So we deceive the brain because the brain doesn't accept the fact that that doesn't really make sense.
And I see the same process by combining photographs.
It's really in combining different reality.
And the things that make a picture, I think they are those that we don't even think, the things that surround us in our everyday lives.
But by combining photographs is very important to consider it, because otherwise something will look bad.
So I'd like to say that there are three simple rules that will continue to achieve realistic results.
As you can see, these images are not very special.
But combined, they can create something like this.
So the first rule is that the combination of pictures must have the same perspective.
Second, combined photos have the same kind of light.
And these two images were going on with these requirements -- they were taken to the same height and with the same kind of light.
The third point is to make you impossible to distinguish the principle and the end of different images with perfect consumption.
It has to be impossible to see where the image was.
This is another example.
And I could think that this is the image of a landscape, and the bottom is manipulated.
But this image is totally composed by photographs of different places.
So I think it's easier to create a place than finding it because you don't need to put the ideas that have in your head.
But it requires a lot of planning.
And as I thought this idea in winter knew that I had several months to plan it, to find the different locations for the pieces of the puzzle.
For example, the fish was captured on a fishing journey.
The costs are from a different location.
The sub-Saharan part was captured in a stone pound.
And yes, I even did red the house of the top of the island so that it seemed more Sweden.
So to achieve a realistic result, I think it makes a lot of planning.
It always starts with a sketches, an idea.
Then you have to combine the different photographs.
And here every piece is very well thinking.
If you do a good job when you take the pictures the results can be very beautiful, and at the same time.
All the tools are there and the only limit is our imagination.
Thank you.
I'll start by showing you a slide about technology, very boring.
Please do it.
It's a diagram that I took from a folder.
I don't really care about showing you the details, but the general thing.
And this is an analysis that we were doing about the potential of the Rickchin Microsoft Microsoft versus the power of local area.
The interesting thing about this is that this one, like many other we tend to see, is a kind of straight line on a logarithmic scale.
In other words, every step here represents an order of magnitude on the performance scale.
Talk about technology with service curves is a novel thing.
So here's something weird happening.
And that's exactly what I'm going to talk about.
Please turn the lights up.
I would need more intensity because writing about paper.
Why do we draw technological curves on logic scales.
The answer is that if you draw them in a normal curve where, say, these are the years, or some unit of time, and this would be any measure of the technology that I want to graduate, the diagram would look something ridiculous.
It would be something like this.
It doesn't say much.
But if you graph, for example, some other technology, like transportation, in a symbolic curve would be very silly, we would see a straight line.
But if something like this, you give a qualitative change.
If the transportation technology would move as fast as microbes, last tomorrow we could take a taxi and be in Tokyo in 30 seconds.
But it doesn't move to that rate.
There are no precedent in the history of technological development of the record that every few years advance orders of magnitude.
The question I want to argue is -- looking at these exponential curves. We see that they don't follow forever.
It's not possible to sustain this change as fast as it goes.
One of two things.
Or it's going to become a typical curve known as this until something completely different, or maybe I'll do something like that.
That's all that can happen.
I'm optimistic, so I think maybe something like this.
To be like this, we would now be in the middle of a transition.
On this line we're in a transition of what used to be the world, a new shape.
So what I try to ask and ask is, what is that new way that you adopt the world?
How new is the world directly?
The transition seems very, very confusing if we're embedded in it.
I remember the future in the year 2000 and people used to talk about what would happen in 2000.
This is a conference where people talk about the future and we see that the future is still the year 2000.
That's all we see.
In other words, the future has been encountered, year after year, throughout my life.
But I think it's because we feel something is happening.
We can feel it.
And we know that it doesn't make a lot of sense to think about 30 or 50 years because everything will be so different than to extrapolate what we're doing today doesn't make any sense.
So I want to talk to you about how it might be, how it could be that transition we experience.
But to do that, I will have to talk a little bit about things that don't have much to do with technology and computer.
Because I think the only way to understand it is taking distance and looking at the long-term things.
The time scale that I'd like to do is the time of life on Earth.
I think this image makes sense if we look at it every billion years.
So we went back to about 2.5 billion years when the Earth was a big star rock with many chemicals floating around them.
If we look at the way that we organize those chemicals we give us an idea of how things happened.
And I think there are theories to start understanding the origin with RNA -- I'm going to tell you a simple version of this, and that is, at that time, he had floating some oil droplet with all kinds of chemical recipes inside it.
Some of those oil droplet had a particular combination of chemicals that made them increase materials from the outside, and so the drops grew up.
And they began to divide.
In a sense, those were the most primitive cell forms, those oil droplet forms.
But those droplets were not alive, in the current sense, because each of them contained a random recycle of chemicals.
And every time they divide they had an unequal distribution of the chemicals that they had.
So every boat was a little different.
In fact, the drops that somehow were wired to be better than the time of incorporating classical chemicals -- they grew more chemicals and they were divided more.
They usually lived longer, they were more related.
It was a way of life, chemical life, very simple, but things became interesting when these droplets learned the trick.
In some way we didn't understand these gates very well, they learned to store information.
They learned to save information, which was the recipe of the cell, in a special chemical called DNA.
In other words, they developed in this meaningless evolution, a writing system that allowed them to register what they were to be able to replicate.
The amazing thing is that that writing system seems to have remained stable since they evolved 2.5 billion years ago.
Our recipe, our genes, have exactly the same code, that same writing system.
In fact, every living is expressed with exactly the same set of letters and the same code.
And one of the things I did just for fun, we can now write things with this code.
Here I have 100 white dust microbes that try to hide the security people in the airport.
But it -- I took this code -- the code has the common letters that we used to use in this -- and I wrote my personal data in this DNA fragments and I amplified it by 10 at 22 times.
So if someone wants 100 million copies from my personal card -- I have a lot of all the speakers -- in fact, for every single person in the world, and it's here.
If it was an elephant would have put it in a virus and would have spread it through the room.
What was the next step?
Writing DNA was an interesting step.
This made these cells happy another billion years.
But then another big step happened in which things became very different, and it was that these cells began to exchange and communicate information forming these cells.
I don't know if you know, but bacteria can exchange DNA.
So for example, they evolved antibiotic resistance.
Some bacteria found a way to avoid penicillin and passed them to create their little DNA with other bacteria and now there are many residents to penicillin because bacteria communicate.
This communication gave place to form communities that, in a way, were together in that, and they established a synergy.
And so they survived or they failed together, or that if a community was very successful all the individuals in that community were recently represented by evolution.
And the inflection point happened when these communities came up so much that, in fact, they came together and decided to write all the recipe of the community together in a DNA chain.
The next interesting stage for life took another billion years.
And at that stage, we have multicellular communities, communities of many different cells working together as a single organism.
In fact, we are a multicellular community.
We have many cells that don't act alone.
The skin cell doesn't serve without the heart, or the muscles, or the brain, etc.
So these communities evolved and produced more interesting levels than the cell phone, something we call an organism.
The next level happened within these communities.
These began to abstract information.
And to build very special structures that didn't make more than process information in community.
They're the neural structures.
The neurons are the devices that process the information that those cell communities built.
In fact, they started to specialize within the community being responsible for recording, understanding and transmitting information.
Those were the brains and the nervous system of those communities.
And that gave them an evolutionary advantage.
Because at that time as individuals, learning was confined to the duration of an organism, not to the evolutionary period of time.
So an organism could, for example, learn not to eat certain fruit because he knew bad and disappeared the last time that it was comedity.
That could happen during the life of an organism since they had built these information processing structures that had been learned for hundreds of thousands of years by the death of individuals who ate that fruit.
So the fact that the nervous system built those information structures will hugely accelerate the evolutionary process.
Because evolution could now happen confined to an individual.
It could happen in the time necessary to learn.
But then, of course, individuals discovered the trick.
So for example, the most refined version we know is human language.
If we think about it, it's an incredible invention.
I have a very complicated idea, a vague idea, in your head.
I'm here sitting here by emitting a few degrees and hopefully building a similar idea, vagina and confused, in his heads that I would hold some analogy with mine.
But we take something very complicated we convert it into sound, in sound, and we produce something very complicated in another brain.
That now allows us to start working as an organism.
In fact, as a humanity, we've started to do abstractions, actually.
Now we go through periods similar to multicellular organisms, we abstract our record methods and presentation and information processing.
For example, the invention of language was a little step in that direction.
The phone, the computer, the video, the Christmas, the Christmas, etc., are the specialized mechanisms that we now build to handle that information.
And that brings us into something much larger and faster and able to evolve more than we were doing before.
Now evolution can happen in microseconds now.
You see the evolutionary example of the Tody in which it produced some evolution with the conversation, before our eyes.
And now we have accelerated the time scales again.
The first stages of history that told them took a billion years each.
The next stages, the nervous system and the brain, took a few hundred million years.
The next one, language etc., took less than a million years.
And the next one, like electronics, seems to take just a few decades.
The process is feedback -- I guess authoritarian is the right word to name something that accelerates its own pace of change.
The more it changes, the faster it does.
And I think that's what we look at in this curve explosion.
We see that the process is forgive.
But I won my life designing computers, and I know that the mechanisms that I employ to design them wouldn't be possible without recent computer advances.
But now design objects of such complexity that would be impossible for me to design them in a conventional way.
I don't know that it does every transistor in that connections machine.
There are billions.
Instead, with the Designers of The The The Machines Machines, we think about a level of abstraction -- we put it in the machine and the machine with that does something that you could not be able to do, it gets far further and faster than ever before.
In fact, sometimes I employ methods that we don't even understand well.
A particularly interesting method, which I've been using lately, is evolution itself.
We put into the machine an evolutionary process that operates on the scale of the microbes.
And for example, in the most extreme cases, we can evolve a program from a random sequence of instructions.
We say, "Please computer, you can run a hundred million sequences of random instructions at random.
Could you run these sequences of institution at random, run all those programs, and take those who are more approaching what we want to do?
In other words, I define what I want.
Let's say I want to order numbers, to put a simple example.
So we found the programs that are more about to order numbers.
Of course, it's unlikely that some random sequences of instructions, ordered numbers, so none of them succeeded.
But one, luckily, could take two numbers in the right order.
And I said, "Computer: Could you take 10 percent of those random sequences that best did the task?
We're going to get those and we get the rest of them.
And we now replicate the most closed numbers.
And we go back to play them by following a process of analog recovery to sex.
We take two programs, which will take children that are exchanging supermarkets, and that children inherit the properties of both programs.
So we got a new generation of programs of programs that had a little bit more success.
And we say, "Please repeat the process.
Californey again.
I introduced some mutations to it.
And it tries again and it tries to get another generation.
Well, each generation takes a few millions.
So I can do the equivalent of millions of years of evolution in a few minutes or in complicated cases, in a few hours.
At the end, we ended up with programs that ordered numbers in absolutely perfect ways.
In fact, they're much more efficient programs than I could have written by hand.
If I look at those programs I can't tell you how they work.
I've tried to analyze them to see how they work.
They are dark programs, strange programs.
But they take the commentary.
In fact, I know, I have the security that you achieve the goal because they come from a hundred thousands of thousands of programs that did it.
In fact, their lives depend on it.
I once went in a 747 with Marie Minneaday, and he runs a card and he says, "Look at this.
He says, "This plane has hundreds of thousands of participants working together to offer a safe flight -- doesn't you feel relative?
We know that engineering processes don't work very well when they become complicated.
So we began to depend on computers to make good design processes.
And that allows us to produce things much more complex than the normal engineering.
However, we don't understand the entire options that there are.
In that sense, it goes from us.
Now we use those programs to make computers much faster, and so we can run these programs much more quickly.
I mean, it's feedback.
The thing is getting faster, and that's why I think it seems so confident.
Because all these technologies are feeding.
We're stopping.
And we're at an analog moment to the single-celled organisms when they became multiple.
We are the threats, and we can't understand what the hell we're creating.
We're at the tipping point.
But I think something comes behind us.
I think it would be very arrogant about our part of thinking that we are the final product of evolution.
And I think that all of us are part of the creation of whatever it is.
But now comes the lunch and I think I'll stop here before they get rid of me.
I think we have to do something with a part of the medical culture that has to change.
And I think this starts with a doctor, and that's me.
And I've been running enough time to allow me to be part of my fake president in that.
Before I treat the theme of my talk, we talk a little bit about baseball.
Why not?
We are close to the end, the World series.
We love baseball, right?
The baseball is full of amazing statistics.
There are hundreds of statistics.
It's going to come out of "Russian Reports: talk about statistics and using them to form a big baseball team.
I'll focus on one of them, and I hope many of you know it.
It's called a bat average.
And we talked about 300 of a battery that fits 300 background.
That means that the car bears effectively, three of 10 times.
That means throwing the ball into the game field without being attacked, and that anyone who tries to launch it to the first base, it doesn't come to time, and the second base will be saved.
Three attempts in 10.
You know how they call a 300-year-old battery in the Great Licks?
Well, really good, maybe the team of stars.
You know how they call a baseball battery?
By the way, that's somebody who is 10 hits a four.
Leadership, like the Ted Williams player -- the latest player of Bill Mars in baseball to execute more 400 hits in a regular season.
Now let's take this to my medicine world where I feel much more comfortable or maybe less uncomfortable, after what I'm going to tell you today.
Suppose they have applications and they're dedicated to a surgeon that has also a 400-pound record in applications.
It doesn't work, right?
Now suppose that they live in a remote place and a loved self has two correcting arteries and your family doctor gives it to a cardiologist whose record in analogy is 200 percent.
But do you know anything?
She's really improving this year.
And their events have been 250.
This is not working.
But I will ask you.
What do you think should be the average average of a heart surgeon or orthopedic surgeon or a collective observation?
1,000. Very good.
And the truth of the issue is that no one in all medicine knows the events of a good surgeon, a doctor or a paradigm.
What we do, however, is to send them into the world, and I included, with the mandate, to be perfect.
That never, again, make a mistake and worry about figuring out how to do it right.
That was the message that was absorbed when I was in medical school.
I was a complicated student.
Once, a fellow in high school said that Brian Gollin studied until for a blood test.
All right.
I studied in my little descend, at the nurses of the General Hospital nurses not far from here.
And I learned everything about memory.
Out of my kind of anatomy -- memorize the origin and the muscle work, the branching of every artery that comes out of the north, and the difference difference and not usual.
And I even knew the difference of the difference about how to classify the kidney nuclear authority.
And while I was so climbing more and more knowledge.
And I was very good. I graduated with honor.
And I went out of medical school with the impression that if I memorize everything, then I would know everything, or the most possible thing, close to the whole thing, because I would join the mistakes.
And it worked for a while, until I met Dr. Drug.
I was a resident in a university hospital here, in Toronto, when they brought the Drug lady to the emergency service where I was working.
At that time, I was assigned to the cardiac service.
And when I used to come up with a cardiologist I got to get to that patient.
It's going to inform the boss of residents.
When I saw Mr. Drug, I was going to go.
I heard a rest sound.
And when I caught it, I heard a barrel sound on both sides, which was given me a cognitive heart failure.
In these conditions, the heart stops working, and instead of moving blood forward, blood goes to the lungs, they fill out of blood, and that's why there is difficulty to breathe.
And it wasn't hard to diagnose it.
I did it and I got to work on the treatment that I would give him.
I gave him aspiration and medication to relieve pressure in his heart.
I gave him diamond, water pills, so I could eliminate liquid liquid.
And in an hour or two, she began to feel better.
And I felt pretty good.
And there it was when he made the first mistake, he sent her home.
It actually made two more mistakes.
He sent her home without talking to the boss of resistance.
I didn't raise the phone and I didn't do what I should have done, which was to call my boss and put it with him to see it.
And if my boss would have seen it, I would have been able to bring a whole bit of a regular information.
Maybe I did it for a good reason.
Maybe I didn't want to be a resident that required constant attention.
Maybe I wanted to be so successful and able to assume responsibility, which could take care of my patients without even contact my boss.
The second mistake that I made was worse.
When you send her home, I didn't pay attention to a voice in my inside that said, "Golden, it's not a good idea. Don't do it."
In fact, I was so insecure that I asked the nurse that he was looking at Mr. Drug, "Do you think it's okay if you go to your home?"
And the nurse thought and then said with total nature," "Yes, I think I'll be OK."
I remember that as if it was yesterday.
So I signed up the high, and the ambulance along with the paradigms took her home.
And I went back to the hospital room.
The rest of that day, that afternoon, I had a bad press in the stomach.
But I followed my job.
At the end of the day, I hit to leave the hospital and walked into the parking parking where my car was to go home. At that time, I did something that I don't normally do.
I went through the emergency service at home.
And there was another nurse, not the one that I care from Mr. Drug before, but another one, I was told by three words, those three words that most emergency medical medical doctors.
Other specialists fear them too, but there is a particular in electronics, and it's that we see patients posted.
The three words are: Is you?
"Do you remember the patient who sent his home?"
I asked the other nurse with total nature.
"Well, she came back with the same voice.
She was fine.
But I went back and on the edge of death.
As a time of an hour to have reached his house, after I gave him the high, he suffered a collapse, and his family called 9911, the paradigms brought it to emergency with an art pressure of 50 miles, which means a severe shock.
I just breathed and blue.
The emergency staff took all their resources.
They gave him medication to raise the arterial pressure.
And they put an artificial breathing.
I was concentrated and I took out to the spinal cord.
He had a mixture of feelings because after they stabilize it was in intensive therapy and waited against every hope that it would recover.
And in the two or three days it was evident that I would never wake up.
He had an irreversible brain.
The family came together.
And in eight or nine days, they met what was happening.
And the ninth day, he left it. The lady Drug, wife, mother and grandmother.
They say they never forget the names of those who die.
That was my first experience.
The next week, I was punished by it and experienced for the first time the marine shame that exists in our medical culture, and I felt alone, isolated without feeling that healthy embarrassment because you can't talk to your colleagues.
You make the peace and never make that mistake.
It's that shame that leaves a teaching.
The bad shame that I talk about is the one that makes us feel very badly inside.
It's the one that tells us not that what we did was wrong, but we're bad.
And that felt that.
And it wasn't by my boss -- he was a lot.
I talked to the family, and I'm sure I was sure that it was supposed to make sure that they wouldn't let me.
And I kept asking those questions.
Why didn't I ask my boss, why did he send her home to his house?
And in my worst moments, why did it make such a dumb mistake?
Why did I choose medicine?
Slowly that feeling was discovered.
And I began to feel better.
And in a cloudy day, the sky opened up and finally came out the sun, and I wondered if I felt better again.
And I made a deal with myself in which if I cut the efforts to be perfect to not make more errors, would make those voices.
And it was.
I went back to work.
But it came back to happen.
Two years later, I was an emergency department in a community hospital in Northern Toronto, and I got a 25 year-old man with a pain in the throat.
I was very busy and applaused.
And he pointed out here.
I looked at his throat. He was a little color.
He gave him penicillin and sent it to her house.
But as he went to the door he kept pointing his throat.
Two days later, when I came to make my guard change, my boss asked to talk to me in his office.
And he proposed the three words, you remember you?
Remember the patient that he saw for a pain in the garage?
He came back and he didn't have a special failure.
I had a potentially fatal affect called emissions.
You can look for it in Google. It's an infection, not from the throat, but in higher air areas, and that can cause the closing of those tracks.
He did not fail.
You can run antibiotics by the interest and it recovered.
And I went through the same period of shame and rooms, then encouraged me and went back to work, until over and over again, and again.
Two times in the same tribe of emergency -- not digitally discussing.
And it's a great effort, especially working in a hospital, because you get 14 patients at the same time.
But in both cases, I didn't send them home, and I don't think it's been a discover.
One of them thought I had a kidney calculation.
They ordered a radio radio radio, but it turned out a normal colleague that was checking the patient perceived a certain sensitivity in the lower right-hand screen and called the surgeon.
The other patient was with a lot of diarrhea.
I read liquid to reinforeer and asked my colleague to check it.
You reviewed it and by noticing some sensitivity in the lower right-hand square, called the surgeon.
Both of them were operated and they were well recovered well.
But every case I was shown down, I was devoted.
But I'd like to tell you that it made the worst mistakes in the first five years of exercise, and as many colleagues say, it's a beach.
The most significant ones have been over the last five years.
Just embarrassed and supported.
And here's the problem: if I can't release and talk about my mistakes, if I can't find the voice that tells me what really happens, how can I share this with my colleagues?
How do I teach them, so they don't make the same errors?
If I would go into a place like this, I would have no idea what you think about me.
When was the last time you heard someone talking about failure, after failure after failure.
Of course, in a party you'll hear about the mistakes of other doctors, but not listen to someone talking about their own mistakes.
And if I knew and my colleagues as well, that a training in my hospital caught the wrong leg, believe me that it would have difficulty to look at the eyes.
This is the system we have.
The total denial of mistakes.
It's the system where there are two positions: those who make mistakes and the ones that don't sleep and the ones that do have a little bit of results and those who have great results.
And it's almost like an ideological reaction, as antibodies that start to attack that person.
We have the idea that if we stop medicine to the people that make mistakes, we will stay a safe system.
But that brings two problems.
In 20 years about diffusion and medical journalism, I've done a personal study of bad medical papers and medical errors to learn the possible, from the first article I wrote for the Toronto Star to my program, "Woman Coach, Black Art -- white art.
And what I learned is that mistakes are concentrating.
We work in a system where mistakes happen every day, where one in 10 drugs prescribed in the hospital are wrong, or description is not right -- in a system where the interactive infections are increasingly and more numbers, causing chaos and death.
In this country they die 24,000 Canadian from avoid medical mistakes.
The U.S. Medical Institute established 100,000 100.
In both cases, it's about driver subsidies, because we're not finding the problem as we should.
And so they are things.
A hospital system where knowledge is multiply every two or three years, and we don't know.
sleep deprivation.
And we can't get rid of it.
We have cognitive biases that allow a perfect history of a patient with pain on the chest.
Now, let's take the same patient with a pain on the chest. I come up with light eyes and an alcohol with alcohol and suddenly my story is telling me.
It's not the same story.
I'm not a robot. I don't do things like that.
And my patients are not cars. They don't relate their symptoms in the same way.
For all of this, mistakes are inevitable.
So if we took the system as they taught us, and we eliminated all the professional professionals to error, well, not to stay anyone.
And with respect to people doesn't want to talk about their most serious?
In my program, "Alligator "Delay, black art, a black art -- it's a habit to say, "This is my worst mistake: I would say to everybody, "This is my worst mistake -- blah, blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah -- "What are your mistakes? And I will lead the microphone to them.
And their students would stop, they would go back, they would go down the head and they were going to start to tell their stories.
They want to tell their stories, they want to share them.
They want to be able to say, "Look, they don't eat the same mistake."
They need a context where we can do it.
They need a reducing medical culture.
And it starts with a doctor every time.
The reported physician is human, you know, it takes it, and it's not proud of their mistakes, but it gets effort to learn from what happened to teach others.
It shares their experiences with them.
It's support for those who talk about their mistakes.
He pointed out the mistakes of other people not with intention to catch them, but in a loving way and support for everybody to benefit.
And it works in a medical culture that recognizes that human beings lead the system, and when this happens, they make mistakes of time at all.
My name is Brian Goldra.
I'm a reduction doctor.
I'm human, I eat mistakes.
And I'm really sorry, but I'm happy to learn something that can transmit others.
I don't know what you think about me, but I can live with that.
And let me conclude with three personal words: I remember it.
Do you know how many decisions we take one day?
Do you know how much we choose in a week?
I recently made a survey for more than 2,000 people and the average amount of choices that say to pick up an American American, are about 70 a day.
It doesn't do a lot, in a research they followed for a week to a group of companies of companies.
Researchers recorded the different tasks who were desperate by these executives and the time that they used to make decisions related to those tasks.
They found that, in average, they get 130 jobs a week.
Naturally, every job included many ministers.
Half of those decisions took nine minutes or less.
Only 12 percent required an hour or more of their time.
Now think about your choices.
Do you know how many people belong to the nine minutes category, and how many of you in an hour?
How do you heat the way that they handle those decisions?
Today I want to talk to you today about one of the biggest problems in the world: choose to get the options.
I want to talk about the problem and some possible solutions.
As I talk about this I'm going to ask you a few questions and I need to know your answers.
When I ask a question, like I'm blind, you raise your hand only if you want to burn calories.
Otherwise, when you ask a question, if your answer is positive, please give a square.
And now my first question of the day, are you ready to hear about the problem of option of options?
Thank you.
Being a graduate student at Stanford University, I had this very, very high level, at least at the time it was very sophisticated.
It's called Dracon.
It was almost like going to a amusement park.
There were like 250 different classes of mustard and violin, over 500 different types of fruits and vegetables and about 25 of the pollent water, and this was when we took water from the graph.
I loved going to that store, but at one occasion, I asked me, why never buy nothing?
This is the open olive stage.
They had more than 75 different classes including those who were in sealed box that come from military trees.
And once I decided to visit the manager and asked him, "Would it work?
He pointed to me the buses full of tourists coming up every day, usually with their cameras.
We decided to do a little experiment with the memories.
Stop.
They had 34 different classes.
We installed a posture to do that, right to the entrance of the store.
We put out there that were similar from six flavors or 24 different flavors and we looked at two things: First, what case was people willing to stop to try to test the member?
More people stopped when there were 24, 60 percent, that when there was only six, 40 percent.
We also looked at what case they were more likely to buy a team of memories.
Here's the opposite effect.
Of those who stopped when there were 24, only three percent came to buy memories.
Of those who stopped when there were six, we saw that 30 percent bought memorized.
If we do the calculations, people had six times more likely to buy if they found six, that if they found 24 times.
Well, deciding that we don't buy a little bit of people that are probably convinced us, -- at least it's good to preserve the line, but it turns out that the problem of the oil overload affects us in very momentous decisions.
We decided not to decide, even though this doesn't convince us.
Now the theme of the day, the financial savings.
So I'm going to describe a study I did with Guardgen Hull, and I love Katrina and Weight Jane, where we looked at the savings on savings for about a million Americans, from about 650 plans in this country.
We were interested in seeing if the number of funding officers available to retirement plans for retirement, the 404 program, they adapted people to save for the future.
And we found that there was really a correlation there.
We had 657 plans that went from two, to 59 different options.
We found that the greater the number of funds, the operating number there was less participation.
So if you look at the extremes, we see that in the plans that offered two funds, the participation rate was 70 percent or more, not as high as it would like.
And in the plans that offered about 60 funds, the participatory rate went down to the 50th percentile percent.
It turns out that even if you decide to participate, when there are more choices, even in that case, there are negative consequences.
So for those who decided to participate, the greater the number of choices, the more people were linked to avoid actions or investment funds.
As soon as there were more choices, they were more willing to invest in financial accounts of market.
But none of these extreme decisions are the ones that we would recommend to optimize the future financial well-being.
In the previous decade we have seen three main negative implications when we offered more and more possibilities.
The most likely thing is that they make the decision, which is even when this goes against the interest.
They are more likely to make the worst decisions in finance and health.
They are more likely to choose less satisfying things, even though they obviously go better.
The main reason is that we manage to look at that giant variety of massive, mustard. Violence and memorial, but we are not able to do the calculations to compare and contract and choose from that awesome exhibition.
Today I want to propose to you four simple techniques that we've tried in one way or another, in different research, so that they can teach their business.
The first is, Corrupt.
You've heard it before, but it's never been more true than today, than less than that.
People always bother when I say, "Barry."
They worry about losing space in the room.
But actually what we're seeing more and more is that if you decide to cut, get rid of weird redundant choices, there will be an increase in the sales -- you'll go down the costs, there's going to be a better experience in choice.
When Process & Gamble went from 26 different types of Hero & Shakespeare to 15, you saw a 10 percent increase in sales.
When the Google Catar corporation eliminated the products for cats that are less sold -- the uses of the users were increased by 75, for two causes, greater sales and less costs.
And you know that the supermarkets today offers 45,000 products.
In a shop of Walmart. It's about 100,000 products.
But the ninth largest store in the current world is Alexander and offers only 1,000 products -- a kind of tomato sauce sauce rate.
In the world of financial savings -- I think one of the best examples that you've come on about how to manage choices better is David Laboo -- the Harvard program.
All of the Harvard employees are automatically embedded to a life security.
People who really want to choose, they offer them 20 funds, not 300 or more.
You know, often people say, "I don't know how to cut it.
They're all important choices.
The first thing I do is ask the employees, tell me the differences that are between those options.
And if your employees can't difference, they will not be able to do your clients."
This evening, before I started this session, I was talking to Garden.
He told me that it would be willing to offer people in this audience a few vacation to the most beautiful road in the world.
Here, a description here.
I want you to read it.
I'm going to leave you a few seconds to read it, and then I want you to give an applause if you're ready to take Garden off.
(Clicks applause) Okay. All right.
Isn't they more?
Well, I'm going to show you something else.
You know there was a trick.
Who is ready for that trip?
I think I actually managed to hear more hands.
All right.
Actually, you had more information in the first round, but I can help you and say that they thought the second time was more real.
Because images made it more real.
This brings me to the second technique to handle the problem of the choices of options, which is Congress.
So that people understand the differences between choices, they have to understand the consequences of every choice, and that consequences must feel very vivid -- very completely.
Why is people spending 15 to 30 percent more on average when it uses debit cards or credit cards than when it uses cash cards?
Because it doesn't seem real money.
It turns out to make it more real, it can be a very positive tool for people to save more.
We did a study with Sally Brother and Alexander Protest, about GDP people who were working on Genergia, these people were in a meeting where they were setting up a 404 plan.
At that meeting, we were aware of exactly how it used to, we did a little addiction.
What we added was that we applied to the staff that they would think about the positive things that would happen in their lives if they save more money.
With this minute there was an increase in 20 percent and an increase in the amount that were interested in saving or what they wanted to put in their savings account, four percent.
The third technique is Capeline.
We can handle more categories than options.
For example, this is a study we did in a magazine hall.
We saw that in the Western supermarkets throughout the Northern corridor, the magazine exhibition can contain from 33 different types of different types of distances to 66.
But you know?
Because classification tells me how to tell them.
These are two shows of judges.
One is called "Jackinson and the other, Sweden."
If you think the one on the left is Swiss, and the one on the right is Japan, they give a palette.
(Clicks applause) Well, there are some students."
If you think the one on the left is Jack, and the one on the right is Swiss, you have a palette.
Well, something else.
Turns out it's right.
The on the left is Jack and the one on the right is Swiss. But you know something?
This classification scheme is totally useless.
Cats have to indicate something that I choose to do, not the ones that define them.
You often see this problem with those huge fundraising.
Do you usually who are informing?
My fourth category: Conference complexity.
It turns out that we can handle a lot more information than we think, if we just simplify it.
We have to increase complexity.
Let me show you an example of what I mean.
Let's look at a very complicated decision, the purchase of a car.
This is a German manufacturer of cars that allow it to be completely performing.
You have to take 60 decisions to build the car.
And these decisions vary in the number of choices that offers each one.
Color, outside of the car. I have 56 possibilities.
Motorcycle, character of change, four options.
What I'm going to do is to vary the order where decisions appear.
So half of the customers are going to go from a lot of options, 56 colors, a few little boxes.
The other half of the customers will go from a few choices, four boxes, to 56 colors, many options.
And what am I going to look at.
How involved you are.
If you act always the button by defect in every decision, this indicates that they're overwhelmed or is: we're losing them.
We found that those who are going from a lot of choices to a few options, they operate the button by the default over and over again, and another more.
We lose them.
If you go from a few options to many, they continue there.
Same information, the same number of options.
The only thing I did was alter the order that information is presented.
If we start with the easy, you learn how to choose it.
Although the box of change doesn't say anything about the preferences of the interior decoration.
We're excited about a product that we're building that now has more hooked with the process.
To sum up.
I've talked about four techniques to mitigate the problem of the optimism of options: Corruption, eliminate strange alternatives -- comprehensive, make it real. Clarity, we can handle more categories with less choices, to condition complexity.
All of these techniques that I've presented to you were designed to help manage alternatives or better, for you, to use them in your issues, or for people who serve them.
It's that I think the key to getting the best of an election is being careful when you choose it.
And the more careful we are in our choices better we can practice the art of choice.
Thank you very much.
In the '80s, in the East Germany, if you had a typewriter of writing should register to government.
You had to register a piece of text text written with the machine.
And this is why the government could track the origin of the text.
If you found a writer with the wrong message, you could track the footprint to the origin of the idea.
In the West, we didn't know that someone could do this, how much this would limit freedom of expression.
We would never do that in our countries.
But today, in 2011, if you buy a laser color laser from any big manufacturing and print a page, that page will end up having some yellow yellow dots on each page that follows a pattern that makes them own and their printer.
That's happening today.
And no one seems to be closed for this.
This is an example of the ways our governments use technology against us, citizens.
And it's one of the three main causes of problems on the network.
If you look at what happens in the online world, we can thank the attacks according to their attacks.
There are three main groups.
They're the communications.
Like Mr. Dimitri Gold in the city of Keith in Ukraine.
The communication phone is very easy to understand.
These guys make money.
They use the cybercriminals to earn a lot of money, huge amounts of money.
There are really many cases of millions online, magnificents, who made money with their attacks.
This is Labral Tasmanians, from Tarah, Stage.
This is Alfred Ronald.
This is Stephen Watherbity.
This is Brown Sun.
These are Matthew Anderson, Tasan Alpha etc., etc., etc.
These guys are doing their online strengths but they do it by illegal media through banking tricks to steal money from our accounts when we buy online, or they steal our keys to get information from our cards when we buy in an infected computer.
The secret service of America, two months ago, frozen the Swiss account of this Mr. James, and this account had 14 million dollars when it was frozen.
Mr. Jamie and supply -- he unknown his stop.
And I say today is more likely than any of us to be victims of a cybercriminal real crime.
And it's very obvious that this is going to be wrong.
In the future, most crimes will happen online.
The second group of attacks that we see today is not motivated by money.
There's another thing that moves them, they motivate them, they motivate them, they motivate them the laughter, they motivate them.
Groups like Anonymous have discovered over the last 12 months occupying a role in the online attacks.
Those are the three main atheists: the criminals that make it for money, the hackers like Anonymous that do it to protect and the last group are the national states that they attack.
And then we see cases like December.
That's a good example of government attacks against their own citizens.
Discipline is a certified authority of the Netherlands, or, actually, it was.
declare the last fall, because of a sacrifice.
They had the security of the site and they had a cyber corruption.
Last week I said, in a meeting with the Dutch government representatives I asked one of the leaders if they found the death of people because of the attack to December.
And the answer of him was yes.
So how do people die from an attack of these?
Discipline is a certified authority.
They sell certainly.
What do the certain certain do?
Well, you need if you have a website with attentions, service services, services like Gamma.
Except that they have a foreign certified authority.
And they emit approach certainly.
And in the case of Diplomat happened exactly that.
And what happened in the Arab Spring, and those things that have happened, for example, in Egypt.
Well, in Egypt the protesters held the headquarters of the Egyptian secret Egyptian in April 2011, and during the bus of the building, they found many papers.
Among those papers was this card called "Smilling."
And within that folder, there were notes from a company in Germany that had sold the Egyptian government tools to intercept the communications of the citizens of the country.
They had sold this tool for 200,000 euros to the Egyptian government.
The bottom of the company is right here.
I mean, Western governments provide the tools to the totalitarian governments to do this to their citizens.
But Western governments are also done by themselves.
For example, in Germany, just a couple weeks ago, the Scott Trek was found -- a Taliban used by the German government officers to investigate their own citizens.
If you're suspicious in a good criminal case, it's pretty obvious that your phone is interested.
But today it's going further.
It involves the Internet connection.
They're going to use even tools like the Science Tree to infect our computer with a trick to allow them to see all the communication, and listen to online arguments, to get our data.
When we think about things like this, the obvious answer should be "Well, it seems bad, but it doesn't actually affect me because I'm an honest citizen.
Why worry about this?
I have nothing to hide."
And that argument doesn't make sense.
It's a privacy game.
Privacy is not discussed.
It's not a matter of privacy against security.
It's about the freedom against control.
If we could trust our governments today in 2011, any right that we are today, will be forever.
Would we trust each future in any future government, in an administration that we could have within 50 years?
These are the questions that we have to worry about in the next 50 years.
This is where I live. I live in Kenya, in the south of National Park.
These are the cows of my dad in the background, and behind the cow, the National Park of Nanopatch.
The National Park in Nairobi has no close in the largest part of the south, which means that wild animals like bees migrate freely outside the park.
And predators, like lions -- follow them, and this is what they do.
They kill our cattle.
This is one of the ones that killed at night, and so soon we stood up in the morning, and we found it a lot of bad because it was the only thing we had.
My community, the mass, we think we came from heaven with our animals and all the land to push them, and so we value them.
So I grew up with the lions.
They die are warriors that protect our community and the livestock and they are also upset with the problem.
So they kill lions.
This is one of the six lions that killed in Nairobi.
I think there's so few in the National Park.
A child in my community, six at nine years old, it's responsible for the livestock of their father and this was the same thing that happened to me.
So I had to find a way to solve this problem.
My first idea was to use fire, because I thought the lions gave them fear.
But I realized that it didn't actually serve it, because it even helped lions to see the size of far.
I didn't give up. It continued.
A second idea was to use a pieces.
He tried to deceive the lions to believe it was near the state.
But lions are very clever.  They came the first day and saw the parking, and they were, but the second day, they came back and said, this thing doesn't move, it's always here.  So they jumped out and killed animals.
So one night I was walking around the style with a torch and that day, lions didn't come.
I discovered that lions are afraid of the light that's moving.
So I had an idea.
And I got a switch that I got to learn and turn out the lights.
And this is a little lamp of a broken line.
It armed everything.
As you can see, the solar panel charges the battery and the battery supplies the electricity into the little individual box. I call it a transformation.
And the industrial box makes lights flow.
As you can see, the bombs give outside, because that's where lions come from.
And that's how you see the lions when they come from night.
The lights flown and they deceive lions to think that I'm walking through the state, but I'm sleeping on my bed.
Thank you.
So I put them in my house two years ago, and since then, we never had a problem with lions.
And the houses of the neighborhood heard the idea.
One of them is this grandmother.
She had killed a lot of animals and asked me if I could put the lights.
I said yes.
I put them out. You can see the bottom, these are the lights for lions.
Since then, I've installed them in seven houses in my community, and they're serving a lot.
And my idea is also used by Kenya, to scare other predators like heads, leaders, and it's also being used to hold elephants out of the farms.
Thanks to this invention, I had a fortune to get a scholarship in one of the best schools in Kenya, Boston International School, and I'm very excited.
My new school is now helping to raise funds and consciousness.
It even led to my friends to my community, and we installed lights in the houses that don't have them, and I teach them how to put them.
So a year ago, I was just a kid in the parents in the savanna carrying my father's cows and I used to see planes fly, and he told me that some day would be inside one.
And here I am.
I got the opportunity to come in airplane for the first time to TED.
My big dream is to get to be an engineer and a pilot when it grows up.
I used to hate the lions, but now as my invention is saving the cows of my dad and the lions, we can be with lions without any conflict.
Highway soul. What in my language means, thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: You don't imagine how exciting it is to listen to a story like yours.
So you got a scholarship. Richard Turkey: Yes.
CA: You're working on other electrical inventions.
What's the next one on your list?
LT: My next invention is -- I want to make a close electricity. CA: A fence close?
LT: I know you already invented the nearby electricity, but I want to do my own.
CA: So you try it once, right? And -- LT: I've tried it before, but stopped because I got a calculator.  CA: At the foot of the Canyon, Richard Turkey, you're a big thing.
We're going to animate in every step that you know, my friend.
Thank you very much. RISD: Thank you very much.
When I was little, I thought my country was the best on the planet.
And I grew up singing a song called "No Development No."
And I felt very proud.
In school, we spent all the time studying the story of Kim IIM, but we never learned much from the rest of the world, except that America, South Korea, Japan are the enemies.
But sometimes I asked myself about the rest of the world, I thought I would spend my entire life in North Korea, until everything changed forever.
When I was seven years old, I saw my first public execution.
But I thought my life in North Korea was normal.
My family wasn't poor and I was never hungry.
But one day, in 1995, my mom brought home a letter of the colleague of my sister.
That said, "When you read this, the five members of the family will stop there in this world, because we haven't eaten in the last two weeks.
We're received together on the floor, and our bodies are so weak. We're ready to die."
I was very high.
It was the first time I heard that people were suffering in my country.
At the short time, when I walked in front of the train station, I saw something terrible I can't erase from my memory.
A homeless woman was dead on the street, holding a kid in her arms looking at his mother without being able to do anything.
Nobody helped them, because they were very concerned about taking care of themselves and their families.
A huge famine.
At the end, more than a million Koreans died during hunger, and just a few survive eating passion, insects and tree cortex.
They also became more and more frequently the energy cuts -- everything around me was completely dark at night except for the lights of the sea in China, barely crossing the river from my home.
I always wondered why they had light, and we don't.
This is a satellite picture of North Korea at night compared to neighboring countries.
This is the river Army, which serves from North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river can be very upset in certain points, allowing Koreans to cross secretly.
But many die.
Sometimes, I see bodies floating in the river.
I can't reveal the details of the North Korea, but I can only say that over the years of hunger, I was sent to China to live with distant patients.
But I just thought I would be separated from my family for short time.
I could never have imagined it would take 14 years to live together.
In China, it was hard to live as a young woman without my family.
I had no idea what life as a Norwegian refugee.
But soon I learned that it's not just extremely difficult, but also dangerous, because the Norwegian refugees in China were considered illegal immigrants.
I was living with a constant fear that my identity was revealed, and it would be reported to a horrible destiny back in North Korea.
One day, my worst nightmare became reality, when I was arrested by the Chinese police and they were interested in police station.
Someone had accused me to be a normal, then they looked at my skills in Chinese language and asked me a lot of questions.
I was terrified.
I thought my heart was going to explode.
If it didn't look natural, it could be incarcerated and depressed.
I thought my life was going to end.
But I managed to control my emotions and answered questions.
At the end of the interrogation an officer told another, "This was a fake report. She's not a robot."
And they let me go. It was a miracle.
Some Koreans in China are looking for a asylum in the foreign ambassador.
But many can be arrested by the Chinese police and depressed.
These women were very lucky.
Although they had captured them, they were eventually released after a harsh international pressure.
These Koreans were not so lucky.
Every year, the North Koreans are captured in China and depressed North Korea, where they are tortured or imprisoned or executed in public.
Although I was lucky to escape a lot of other Koreans haven't been so lucky.
It's tragic that the Koreans have to hide their identities and fight so hard just to survive.
Even after learning a new language and finding work, all their world can be used in a second.
That's why after 10 years of hiding my identity, I decided to risk going to South Korea.
And I started a new life again.
And in South Korea, it was a much greater challenge than I was waiting for.
English was very important in South Korea, I had to start learning my third language.
Also, I understood that there was a big gap between North and South Africa.
We are all Koreans, but inside, we have become very different because of 67 years of divide.
They even attract an identity crisis.
Am I surface or a normal?
Where am I? Who am I?
Suddenly, there was no country that could call me a pride of mine.
Although to adapt to life in South Korea, it wasn't easy, I made a plan. I started studying for the research to college.
Just when I started to adapt to my new life, I got a called alarming call.
The North Korean authorities involved some money that sent my family, and as I punishment my family was going to be displaced to the force to a local location outside.
They had to swim away.
So I started planning how to help them escape.
North Koreans have to travel long distances on the way to freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North Korea and South Korea.
So ironically, I took a flight to China and I walked into the border with North Korea.
Because my family couldn't speak Chinese, I had to guide them in some way, for more than 3,000 miles across China and then through Southeast Asia.
The bus journey took a week, and we almost were caught several times.
Once, our bus was arrested and draws by a Chinese police officer.
He asked the identity of everybody and started asking them questions.
As my family couldn't understand Chinese, I thought my family was going to be arrested.
When the Chinese officer came up to my family, I suddenly stood down, and I told him that they were something that was seen by a company.
I looked at it successfully but fortunately I believed me.
We did all the way to the Laden border.
But I had to spend almost all my money to bribe the border guards in Lades.
But even after the border passed, my family was arrested and imprisoned to cross the border illegally crossed.
After paying multimedia and supply, my family was released in a month.
But in time, my family was arrested and imprisoned again in the Laden capital.
This was one of the lowest dots in my life.
I did everything to liberate my family, and we were so close, but my family was retreated in prison at the short distance of the South Korea.
I was going and came between the immigration office and police station, desperately trying to liberate my family.
But I didn't have enough money to pay more bribes or multimeters.
I lost hope.
At that time, or the voice of a man asking, "What is the problem?
I was so surprised that a stranger would matter to ask.
With my poor English and with a dictionary, I explained the situation, and no doubt -- the man was to the ATM and gave me the rest of the money for my family and for other two Koreans and take them out of prison.
I thank him with all my heart, and I asked him, "Why do I help me?
"I'm not helping you, he said.
"I'm helping the normal village."
I realized that that was a symbolic moment in my life.
The nice unknown symbolizes a new hope for me and for the Norwegian village when we needed it.
And I showed that the kindness of the unknown and support of the international community is really the hope of hope that the Norwegian village needs.
Over time, after our long journey, my family and I met in South Korea.
But achieving their freedom is just half of the battle.
Many Koreans are separated from their families, and when they go to a new country, they start with little or no money.
So, we can benefit from the international community with education, English language practices, job practices, and more.
We can also act as a bridge between people inside North Korea, and the rest of the world.
Because many of us continue in contact with families still inside, and we send information and money that is helping to change North Korea from within.
I've been very lucky, I've received a lot of help and inspiration in my life, so I want to help governments an opportunity to thrive with international support.
I'm sure you're going to see more and more Koreans transforming around the world, including on the TED stage.
Thank you.
I live in South Central Center.
This is South Central Center -- landscapes, fast food, soft ground.
So the city planners came together and thought, we're going to change the name of the South Center to represent something else, so they changed the South Angeles, as if this would fix what's actually wrong in the city.
This is the South Angeles --  Landary stores, fast food, soft terrain.
Just like 26 million other Americans, I live in a food desert, the Angeles Center, home of food places to bring and eat in the car.
The curious thing is that food places to take kill more people than food in the car.
People are dying of curable diseases in Los Angeles Center Security.
For example, the obesity rate in my neighborhood is five times larger than, say, Beverly Hills, which is about 15 miles away.
I'm tired of seeing this happen.
And I ask myself, how would you feel if they didn't have access to healthy food, and if every time you come out of home you see the effects that the current food system has in your neighborhood?
I see wheelchair breakthroughs bought and sold as cars.
I see centers of dollars like Strewhitaristic.
And I think this should stop.
I think the problem is the solution.
Food is the problem, and it's the solution.
I also stopped to drive 45 minutes out of the road and go back to buy an apple that doesn't have pesticides.
What I did, I was planting a food forest in front of my house.
In a land of land we call a garden.
It's about 45 feet three feet.
The point is, it belongs to the city.
But you have to keep it.
I said, "Well, I can do what comes to me, because it's my responsibility and I have to keep it."
That's how I decided to keep it.
So my group and I, L.A. Green Greeks, we put together and started planting our food forest -- fruit trees, you know, the nine complete vegetables.
What we do, we are a kind of group paid by granted by administrators of all the spaces, all of the city and completely volunteers, and everything we do is free.
And the garden, I was beautiful.
Then someone complained about.
The city came up to me and in short, they gave me a cataractor saying that I had to remove my garden, the cataractor became a legal order.
And I said, "Come on, really?
A court order for planting food in a piece of land that no one matters?  So I was like, "Well, let's get it."
Because this time I wasn't going to happen.
L.A. Times had the story written by Steve Lapera, and I spoke to the core and one of Green Groupers, who put a petition in Change, with 900 signatures -- we were a success.
We had the victory in our hands.
My boss even called to say they were back and they love what we were doing.
I mean, let's go, why not?
L.A. is the city of the United States with more barriers ball.
It's 68 miles away from balls.
That equals 20 Central Park.
That's enough space to plant 725 million tomato plants.
Why do you don't think of this?
It will grow a plant to give you, 10,000 seeds.
When a dollar of hands will give you 75 dollars a result.
It's my hymnetch, when I tell people, you grow your own food.
Growing your own food is how to print your own money.
You see, I have a legacy for South Central Center.
I grew up there. I grew up my kids there.
I'm afraid to be part of this manufacturing reality that was manufactured for me, and I'm going to manufacture my own reality.
You see, I'm an artist.
The garden is my graffiti -- I grow my art.
Just like an artist of graffiti -- which is put up walls, I promote soils, gardens.
I use the garden, the land, like a piece of canvas, and the plants and the trees, are my empire of that canvas.
You'd be surprised to see what the earth can do, if you let it be your canvas.
You just can't imagine the amazing thing that's a scream and how people affect people.
What happened?
I'm a witness of how my garden became a tool of education, of transformation of my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of land.
We are the land.
You'd be surprised to see how it affects kids.
The garden is the most therapeutic act and provocative act that you can do, especially in a robot.
Also, they get cold.
I remember an occasion, which came a mother and his daughter, and they were like 10 o'clock at night and they were in my backyard, and they were out and looked very apparent.
I, well, man, I felt bad that they were there, and I said, you know, you don't have to do this.
This is on the street for a reason.
I felt shame when I saw people who were so close to me with hunger, and this only reinforces why I do this, people ask me, "Final -- not afraid that people are going to steal your food?
I say, "For God, I don't fear that you're going to steal it.
That's what it's on the street.
That's what it's about.
I want you to take it, but at the time, I want you to delay your health.
There was another case that I put a garden in a reduce in the center of Los Angeles.
They were these guys, which helped me download the truck.
It was fabulous. I was shared their stories about how this had affected them and how they used to plant with her mom and his grandmother, and it was fabulous to see how this changed them, so just for a moment.
So Green Greeks has come to plant maybe 20 garden.
We've had about 50 people who come from, work and participate, all in voluntary plan.
If kids grow color, kids eat color.
If you grow tomatoes -- you eat tablets.  But if none of this will be taught you, if you don't teach them how food affects your mind and body, you eat blind to you in front of it.
I see young people who want to work, but they have this thing that they're caught in, and I see color kids who are in this path designed for them, which doesn't take them anywhere.
With the garden, I see an opportunity in which we can train these kids who are getting out of their communities to have a sustainable life.
And when we do this, who knows?
Maybe it's produced the next George Washington Carron.
But if we don't change the composition of land, we will never do it.
Now this is one of my plans, this is something I want to do.
I want to plant a whole block of gardens where people can share food in the same box.
I want to take containers and convert them into healthy capitals.
Don't get me wrong.
I'm not talking about free things, because free is not sustainable.
The curious thing about sustainability, is you have to support it.
What I'm talking about is putting people to work with people, taking kids in the street, who know the joy, the pride and the honor of growing their own food, opening farmers.
What I want to do here, we have to make it sexy.
I want all of them to become ecological restores, sensors, gangsters an international.
We have to change the script of what's a service.
If you're not a garden, you're not a sensor.
That the wars take their painting OK?
That is your choice weapon.
In fact, if you want to meet me, well, if you want to see me, you don't call me if you want to sit in comfortable chairs and have meetings, to talk about making some shit, to talk about making some shit.
If you want to see me, come to the garden with your palette so we can plant something.
peace. Thank you.
Thank you.
(Music noises)  (So noises)  You probably all agree with me where this is a very nice road.
It's made of asphalt and asphalt is a good material to drive, but not always, especially not in days like today, where it rains a lot.
You can have a huge amount of water in the asphalt that sales out.
And especially if you go on your bike and these cars pass out, that's not very nice.
Also, asphalt can do a lot of noise.
It's a noisy material, and if we build roads, like in the Netherlands, very close to cities, we would want a quiet road.
The solution for that is to make perfect applications careers.
The powerful asphalt -- a material that we use now in most roads in the Netherlands, has pores and water can pass through it, so the whole rain water will flow up to the sides and have a road that is easy to drive, and not be able to jump water again.
Noise will also disappear in these pores as well.
Because it's very horrible, all the noise will disappear, so it's a very quiet road.
It also has advances, of course, and the disadvantage of this road is that you can get rid of it.
What is it? See that in this road, the stones of the surface are coming out.
First one stone, then several more and more and so on, and then -- well, I'm not going to do that.  But you can give him your devices, and you're not happy with that.
And finally, this can also lead to more and more damage.
Sometimes they can create bacteria with that.
Oh, it's ready.
Baches, of course, they can become a problem, but we have a solution.
Here you can actually see how the damage appears in this material.
It's a powerful applause, as I said, so it only has a little amount of advanced between the stones in between.
Because of the internal, the local light, the oxygen, this bottle, this bottle, the glue between the risks, will be scaled, and if you get together, you will be able to get microscopes and you will separate from the addicts.
So, if you drive through the road, you will take the ads -- as we saw it here.
To solve this problem, we think about subsidian materials.
If we can make this material self-seeing, then we probably have a solution.
So what we can do is use steel wool -- that to clean sandwiches, and we can cut the steel wool in very small pieces, and we can mix those little bits with the bottle.
So we have a little bit of asphalt with little pieces of steel wool in it.
Then you need a machine, like the one you see here, that you use to cook -- an industry machine.
The instruction can heat up, especially steel -- is very good at that.
So what you have to do is heat the steel -- melt the bottle, the bathroom flow through these microscopes, and the stones will go back to the surface.
Today I used a microwave oven, because I can't bring the big introduction machine here to the stage.
The microphone oven, it's a similar system.
I put the sample, which I'm now going to take to see what happened.
This is the show that comes out now.
I said we have this kind of industrial machine in the lab to heat the samples.
We tried a lot of samples there, and then the government, really saw our results, and they thought, "Well, that's really interesting. We have to try it."
So they donated us a piece of road, 400 meters from the 285 highway, where we had to make a test lane to test this material.
So that's what we did there. You see where we were doing the test test, and then, of course, this road lasts several years without any harm. That's what we know about practice.
We take a lot of samples from this road, and we test them in the lab.
We made the samples, we put a lot of charge on them, we put them out then with our industry machine and we took them off, and we went back and test them.
We can repeat this many times.
Well, to conclude, I can tell you that we've made a material using steel fibers, incorporating these fibers -- using the energy of industry to actually increase the life of the surface of the road, even you can double the life of the surface, and you actually save a lot of money with very simple tricks.
And now, of course, they have curiosity.
We still have the show here. It's pretty hot.
In fact, you have to cool first before I can show you how the repair is.
But I'm going to make a try.
Let's see. Yeah, it worked.
Thank you.
When I was 11 years old, I remember waking up one morning with the sound of the board in my house.
My father was listening to BBC News in her little gray radio.
He had a great smile in his face that was unusual in those times, because the news generally depressed it.
"The Taliban were, I scream my father.
I didn't know what it meant, but I could see my father was very, very happy.
"Now you can go to a real school, he said.
One morning I will never forget.
True school.
You see, I was six years old when the Taliban came out of Afghanistan and made illegal that girls went to school.
For the next five years, I was dressed as a child to hide my older sister, who could no longer be used to go to a secret school.
It was the only way we were able to educate them.
Every day, we took a different route so that no one could suspect where we are.
We had to hide the books on the market bags so that it would seem to be shopping.
The school was in a house, over 100 of us stuck in a small room.
It was nice in the winter, but extremely hot.
We all knew we risk our lives, the teacher, the students and our parents.
Every once in a while, school was suddenly closed for a week, because the Taliban supported.
We always wondered what they knew about us.
Were they following us?
Did you know where we live?
We were locked up, but still, school was where we wanted to be.
I was very lucky to grow in a family where education was appreciated and the daughters a treasure.
My grandfather was an extraordinary man for his time.
A total support of a remote province of Afghanistan, insisted that his daughter, my mother, went to school, and so his father broke it.
But my educated mother became teacher.
This is it.
It will retire two years ago, just to convert our home into school for girls and women from our neighborhood.
And my father, this is, was the first of all his family to receive education.
There was no doubt that their children had to receive education, even their daughters, despite the Taliban.
For him, there was a greater risk in not educating their children.
Over the years of the Taliban, I remember there were moments when I was very frustrated by our life and was always scared and didn't see a future.
I wanted to quit, but my father said, "Mai, my daughter -- you can lose everything you have in life.
They can steal your money. They can force your house during a war.
But there's one thing that will always be with you, what's here and if we have to sell our blood to pay your education, we'll do it.
So you still want not to go?
I am 22 years old.
I grew up in a country that has been destroyed by decades of war.
Less than six percent of women in my age have more than the galaxy, and if my family hadn't been so committed to my education, I would be one of them.
Instead, I found myself here proud to graduate in Microsoft College.
When I went back to Afghanistan, my grandfather, the one who was removed from his home for the courage of educating her daughters, was one of the first to congratulate her.
He wasn't only played from my college degree, but also that I was the first woman, and I'm the first woman to drive him through the streets of Kabul.
My family believes in me.
I dream in big, but my family has even bigger dreams for me.
That's why I am the global ambassador of 1939, a global campaign to educate women.
That's why I cofounded SOLO, the first and perhaps the only private school for girls in Afghanistan, a country that is still risky for girls to go to school.
The exciting thing is that I see students in my school with the strong desire to leverage the opportunity.
And I see their parents and their families who, like mine, advocate for them, despite and still in front of a decentralized opposition.
Like American. It's not his true name, and I can't show you his face, but Ahmed is the father of one of my students.
Less than a month ago, he and his daughter would go from SOLO to her village, and literally they escaped from being killed by a bomb on the way, for minutes.
When you get home, they are the phone, a voice gave him that if he kept sending his daughter to school, they would try and try.
"You know, if you want to, he said, "But I won't harm the future of my daughter for your old and reduced ideas.
What I've realized about Afghanistan, and it's something that is often forgotten in the West, is that behind most of us triangulated, there's a father who recognized the value of his daughter and he sees that the success of her own success.
It doesn't mean our mothers have been key in our success.
In fact, they are often the first compelling interests of the brilliant future of their daughters, but in the context of a society like Afghanistan, we need the support of men.
Under the Taliban. The girls who went to school are told in hundreds -- remember, it was illegal.
But today, over three million girls go to school in Afghanistan.
Afghanistan looks so different from here in America.
I find Americans see the fragility of change.
And I fear these changes didn't last much, after the retreat of the U.S. troops.
But when I go back to Afghanistan, when I see students in my school and their parents who advocate for them, they encourage them, I see a promise and a lasting change.
And for me, Afghanistan is a country of hope and limited possibility, and every day the SOLO girls remember it.
Like me, they dream big.
Thank you.
I've never forgotten the words of my grandmother's grandmother who died in the exile. Hello, resistant to Gaddafi, fought him.
But you never have a revolutionary real Galapagon?
They have spent almost two years since I was establishing the released revolution inspired by the soldiers of massive mobility both the Tunisian revolution as much as the Egyptian revolution.
A forces with a lot of other civil citizens, inside and outside the country to call a factory day and start a revolution against the Tabland recording of Galapagon.
And we did it. It was a big revolution.
Women and young men were in the forefront conversation, demanding the fall of the regime, by taking away freedom, dignity and social justice.
They have shown a courageous to be able to make the dictatorship of Galdinator.
They've shown a big sense of solidarity from the East East, to the west, to the south.
Finally, after a period of six months of brutal war and some losses of about 50,000 dead, we managed to liberate our country and go through the train.
However, Gaddafi left a parade of charge, a language legacy, corruption and alternative seeds.
For four decades, the American regime of Gaddafi, destroyed infrastructure, culture and moral structure of free society.
Consideration of devastation and challenges, I have loved -- along with many other women, rebuild the free civil society, demanding an inclusive transition and fair towards democracy and national reconciliation.
So they set up about 200 organizations in Beijing during the day, immediately after the fall of Galapagon.
After a 33-year-old period, I went back to Libya, and with a unique enthusiasm I began to organize workshops about developing capacity, and leadership skills.
With an incredible group of women we founded the Lab of Women Liberia Platform for peace, a movement of women, leaders, very diverse orientation, to advocate by the social autonomy of women and for our right participation of participation in the construction of democracy and peace.
I found a very difficult environment in the prefrontal period -- an environment that was increasingly polarized -- which is model from selfish policies and exclusion.
Over time, our initiative was approved and successful.
Women won a 17 percent of the National Congress in the first 52 years.
Nevertheless, the culture of elections and revolution as a whole, they were disappearing, every day we found the news of violence.
One day we wake up with the news of ancient mosques and Sufi tumors.
Another day threatened with the news of the American ambassador and the attack to the result.
Another day we wake up with the news of the army officers in the army.
And every day, every day we wake up with the government of the military and the continents of human rights violences and their lack of respect of law.
Our society, shaped by a revolutionary mindset, is polited more, and it's gone away from the ideals and principles of freedom, dignity, social justice, that we had at the beginning.
The intuition, the exclusion and the venom became the icon of the consequences of the revolution.
I'm not here today at all to inspire you with our history of the surgery of "regret" and elections.
Rather, I'm here today to trust that we, as a nation, choose wrong, make the wrong decision.
We didn't prioritize well.
Because elections didn't bring peace, stability and security to Libya.
The cruel list and the alternative between candidates and candidates brought peace and national recycling?
No, they didn't.
What happened then?
Why is our society still polarized and dominated with selfish selfish policies and exclusion.
Perhaps what I failed was not just women, but women's values of compassion, mercy and inclusion and inclusion and inclusion and inclusion and inclusion and inclusion and inclusion and inclusion and inclusion and inclusion and inclusion and inclusion and inclusion and inclusion and inclusion and inclusion and inclusion and inclusive.
Our society needs national dialogue and the creation of consensus more than it needed the choices, which only reinforce polarization and divide.
Our nation needs the qualitative representation of female females than need the numerical representation and quantitative of it.
We need to stop acting as a language agents and call days of anger.
We need to start acting as agents of compassion and mystery.
We have to develop a female speech, which is not just honor but also putting the mercy in practice instead of revenge. collaboration instead of competition, inclusion instead of exclusion.
These are the ideals that a Libya, destroyed by war, needs desperately to get peace.
Because peace has an airplane that deals with the interface and the alternative between female perspectives and males.
That's the real brilliant.
We need to establish that in an existential way before we do it solar form.
According to a view of the Koran "Shake: Peace -- is the word of the Missile God, Justice, compassionate God.
At the same time, the word "Randa: which is known in all the British traditions, it has the same root in Arabic that the word Rain: synthesized the female and material, which spans all of humanity that men and women, where all tribes and all people have emanged.
And so, just like the uterus is completely covering the embryo, which grows inside, the divine matrix of compassion the whole existence.
This is what it says to us, "My mystery about all things.
This is what it says to us, "My mystery is about my arm."
That all of them are considered the grace of the mercy.
Thank you.
I'm here today to talk to you about an amazing question, which has an equally incredible answer.
It's about the secrets of domestic violence, and the question I'm going to deal with is the one that everybody does always, why she stays?
Why was someone going to stay with a man who put him pull?
I'm not a psychiatrist, no social worker, no expertise in domestic violence.
I'm just a woman with a story I'll tell you.
I was 22 years old. I had just released at Harvard University.
I had moved to New York for my first job as a writer and an editor in the Sendrent magazine.
I had my first apartment apartment, my first green American Administration American, and I had a very big secret.
My secret was that many, many times, the man, that I created my soul twin -- I was pointing to my head with a gun.
The man, whom I loved more than anybody in this world, put a gun on my head and threatened with killing more times than I can remember.
I'm here to tell you the story of "lock love, a psychological trick, failure of love, where they fall every year millions of women, and even some men.
It could be your story.
I don't look like a typical survival of domestic violence.
I'm licensed in English at Harvard University, and I have a MBA in marketing from the Washington Business School at Mark.
I've spent most of my career working for the Fortune 500 list, between them Johnson & Johnson, Leo Burken and The Washington Post.
I take almost 20 years married with my second husband, and we have three children.
My dog is a black calendar and I drive an Honor Odyssey.
So my first message for you is that domestic violence can happen to anyone, all the race, all the religion, all the relative levels and education.
It's everywhere.
And my second message is that everybody thinks that domestic violence happens to women, which is a women's problem.
Not exactly.
More than 85 percent of the males are men, and the domestic abuse only happens in intimate relations, interdependence and long diagram or, saying otherwise, in families, the last place we want or expect to find violence, reason why, the domestic abuse is so decreased.
I would have told them that it would be the last person in the world that would stay with a man who hit him, and in fact, I was a very typical victim because of my age.
I was 22 years old, and in the United States women have three and 24 years of age they have three times more likely to be victims of domestic violence than other ages, and over 500 women and girls from that age are killed every year by partners, boyfriend.
I was also a typical victim because I didn't know anything about domestic violence, his warning signals or their patterns.
I met Congo in a cold and rainy night of January.
I was sitting next to my side in New York subway and started to fight with me.
He told me two things.
The first one was that he was also getting rid of a university of the Great Line and working in a very important bank by Wall Street.
But what struck me most in that first encounter was that it was ready and fun, and that seemed like a kid in the field.
He had a little bit of big flats like apple apples and a little bit of a Russian flying hair, and it seemed so sweet.
One of the smartest things that Congress did, from the beginning, was to create the illusion that I was the dominant component of the partner.
He did it mostly at the beginning putting me on a pedestria.
We started coming out and loved everything from me, which was list, that I had gone to Harvard, which was passionate to help teenage girls and my work.
I wanted to know everything about my family, my childhood, my dreams and illusions.
Congress believed in me, as a writer, and as a woman, as no one had ever done it.
And that's why the lesson in that prestigious school and the work in Wall Street and his bright future had so much for him.
I didn't know that the first phase in any relationship of domestic violence is to surround and tell the victim.
And I didn't know that the second step is to isolate it.
Now, the last thing I wanted to do was to go from New York and leave the work of my dreams, but I thought I had to make sacrifices for your partner, so I agreed I quit my work and Congress and I went together from Manhattan.
I had no idea that I was falling in a love lock, which was entering a head in a physical train, financial and psychological training carefully ready.
The next step in the domestic violence pattern is to introduce the threat of violence to see how she reacts it.
And this is where you go into the scene those landscapes.
And as we moved to New England you know, that site where Congo was supposed to feel so safe was bought three stores.
One was in the car.
Another lady underneath the pillow in our bed, and the third always in his pocket.
And he said he needed those landscapes because of the trauma that he lived from small.
I needed them to feel safe.
But those stores actually were a message for me, and although I had never raised my hand, my life was already serious danger, every minute in every day.
The first physical attack in Congo happened five days before our wedding.
It was seven o'clock in the morning and I still had the career.
Five days later, when the 10 bruises of my neck had disappeared, I put my mother's wedding suit, and I married him.
Despite what had happened, I was sure that we were going to live happily forever, because I loved it, and he also wanted me a lot.
And I was very, very relieved.
He just had felt very observed by the wedding and the fact to form a family with me.
I had been an isolated accident, and I would never get hurt.
I spent twice as much in our honey moon.
The first time I was driving towards a secret beach and lost me, and he gave me so hard in the head that I stole several times against the colony of the car.
And then, a couple of days later, driving back from our moon of honey -- was covered by the traffic and threw me a Big Mac cold to the face.
Congress continued to go on one or twice a week for the next two and a half years of our marriage.
I was wrong when I thought it was the only one in this situation.
One in three American women is victims of domestic violence or harassing at some point in their life, and the Centers Control Center that every year 15 million children are married, 15 million.
So actually, I had very good company.
Going back to my question: Why did I get it?
The answer is simple.
I didn't know he was abusing me.
On the contrary, I was a very strong woman in love with a deeply crowded man, and it was the only person in the world who could help Congo face his devils face.
The other question that everybody does is, why isn't it that married?
Why didn't I go? I could have been at any time.
For me, this is the saddest and painful question that people do, because we victims, we know something that normally you are ignorant], is incredibly dangerous to abandon a male.
Because the last phase in the domestic violence pattern is killing it.
More than 70 percent of the murder in the case of domestic violence is happening after the victim has put on the end of the relationship, after they go back, because then the abuse has nothing to lose.
Other implications include the permanent compass, even after the abuse has become married, financial resources, financial resources, and manipulation of the family court system to land the victim and their children, who are usually forced by judges to spend no superconducting time with the man who was beating their mother.
And yet we keep asking why it's simply not going?
I was able to go, because I was able to go, because of one final slide that I sold my denial.
I realized that the man who loved so much, would have killed me if I had allowed it.
So I broke the silence.
I told everybody the world to the police, my neighbors to my friends and friends to my friends and family, and I'm here today because everybody helped me.
We have the tendency to strategic victims as smart headlines -- automatically women women, damaged goods.
The question, "Why is it left?
For some people it's a way to say, "The guilt is your being a little bit of your spin," as if the victims are going to be intensively to fall in love with men who want to destroy us.
But since I published "Pach Love," I've heard hundreds of stories of men and women who were also shaking, who learned an intellectual lesson from what happened to them and redesigned their lives and happy lives like employees, wives, and mothers, completely free lives of violence, like mine.
Because it turns out that I actually am a victim and a very typical domestic violence.
I became married with a teenage and nice, and we have those three children.
I have that black lab, and also that minimity.
What I'm not going to go back to have ever more, again, is a laughing landscape pointing to my head in the hands of someone who says I want.
Right now, you're thinking, "Oh, that's fascinating, or "Haltimora, what a silly it was, but all this time, I've actually been talking about you.
I assure you that there are a few people, from those who are listening to me right now, that they're being mapped or that they were small or that they are observers.
The bat could be affecting his daughter, his sister, to his best friend right now.
I was able to end my crazy particular love by breaking the silence.
And I keep doing it today.
It's my way to help other victims, and it's my last request to you.
They talk about what you've heard here.
The abuse is just preserved in silence.
They have the power to end up with domestic violence simply throwing light on it.
The victims need everybody.
We need each of you to understand the secrets of domestic violence.
They take the bat to light talking about it with their children, their coworkers and their friends and family.
They rethink their vision of survivors as fantastic and lovely people, who have a full future.
They recognize the early signs of violence to intervene consciously, to slow up their scale and show the victims a safe output.
Together, we can convert our beds, our tables and our families in the safe and peaceful oceans that should be.
Thank you.
Hello. I call me Cameron Russell, and for a while, I'm a model.
To be precise, for 10 years.
And I feel like at this moment there is an uncomfortable tension in the room because I shouldn't have seen it like this.  Luckily, I've brought clothes to change.
This is the first carbon change on a TED stage, so you are very lucky to present it, I think.
If some of the women were horrified when I came up, they don't have to tell them now, but I'll find it later on Twitter.
I also want to point out that I have the privilege of being able to change what you think about me in just 10 seconds.
Not everybody has that opportunity.
These guys are very uncomfortable, less bad than I don't have to use them.
The worst part is to pass this guy up by your head, because it's when you're going to laugh at me, so they don't do anything as I get my head.
All right.
Why have I done this?
It's been embarrassing.
Well, I hope not as much as this picture.
The appearance is powerful, but it's also surface.
I've completely changed what they thought about me in six seconds.
And in this picture, I had never had a boyfriend in real life.
I was totally uncomfortable and the photographer told me that he would argue the back, and that he would accelerate the hair.
Of course, except with surgery or an artificial tan like the one that I did two days ago for the work, there is very little that we can do to transform our respect, which, although the surface and immune, has a big impact in our lives.
So today, to me, being brave means being honest.
I'm on this stage because I'm a model.
Because I'm a nice, white woman, and in my workforce, that's a sexy girl.
I'm going to answer the questions that people are always doing me, but sensitive.
The first question is, how do you get to be model?
And I always say, a huntistan discovered, but that doesn't mean anything.
The real reason I made model is because it won the genetic lottery. And I'm the benefit of a heritage -- and maybe you're wondering what this heritage is.
Well, in the last few centuries, we have not only defined beauty as health, youth and symmetry -- which we are biologically programmed to admire -- we also associate it at a high and stereotype figure, to the feminist and a white skin.
And that's my heritage that I've been able to tap to make money.
And I know there are people in the audience that now is specifically shown -- and maybe there are some moments of the fashion they say -- wait. There are Naomi Nation, Tora, Joan Shamogoles, Lou West.
First of all, happy for knowing so much about models. It's amazing.
But unfortunately, I have to report that in 2007, a Ph.D. student from New York University told each and every single models in the runway, and from the 775 hired models, only 27, that is, less than four percent, they weren't white.
The next question that people always ask me is, can it be model when it's up?"
And my first answer is: I don't know, I don't love that.
But then, what really would tell each of these girls is, why? You can be what you want.
You can be president from the United States, or the inventor of the next Internet, or a native communication surgeon, which would be impressive, because you would be the first one.
If after this spectacular list, you still insist -- no, no, Cambodia, I want to be model, then I say, "I know my box.
Because I am not in charge of anything, and you could be the newsroom of the American magazine magazine or the MRI executive director or the next Steven Melinda.
To say that the more you want to be a model is like saying you want to win the lottery when you are larger.
It's outside your control, it's amazing, and it's not a job you can choose.
I'm going to demonstrate everything I learned in 10 years as a model, because, unlike corporate surgery, it can be summarized right now.
I don't know what happened there.
Unfortunately, once you've finished your studies, and you have a curve and a few jobs to your backs, no longer matter what you say, you know, if you said you want to be president from the United States, but your curve said, "Standard clothes for 10 years, people would look weird.
The next question that people always do is whether all the pictures are returned.
And yeah, they are basically rethinking all the pictures, but that's just a small part of what happens.
This was the first picture that took me, and also the first time I used a Bionicol, and I didn't even have my own period.
I know we're entering the personal ground, but it was a girl.
This is how it looks like my grandmother a few months earlier.
These two pictures are the same day.
My friend came with me.
Here I am at a party party a few days before the photos for the French vote.
Here I am with my football team and at the V.
And this is me today.
And I hope you realize that I'm not me in those pictures.
They are creations of a group of professionals, piles, machines, photographers and stations, and all their aid and patient people, and they get to create this. That's not me.
Well, the next question that people always ask me is: Do you get free things?
I have too many seats of 20 inches and I never use, except the last couple but the privilege I get in real life, and what we don't like to talk about.
I grew up in Cambridge, and once I went to a store and forgot to bring money, and I was given the free dress for free.
When I was a teenager, I traveled with my friend who was a present driver -- he jumped out a red self-assembly, and of course, they stopped us, and I had a sorry, agent to be able to keep going.
I enjoy these privilege for me, not for what I am. And there are people who are paying a price for their aspect without matter who they are.
I live in New York City, and last year, from the 14,000 teenagers to those who were stopped and record, 86 percent were black and Latino -- and most of them were young men.
And there are only 177 young black children and Latin in New York, so for them, it's not a question of me?
But how many times are I going to stop me? And when.
By researching for this talk, I found out that 53 percent of the 13 year-old girls in the United States don't like their body, and that number goes to 78 percent at the age of 17.
So the last question that people ask me is, how is life of a model?
And I think the answer that you expect is: If you're a little bit more thin and you have the brightest hair, you feel very happy and great.
And behind the cameras, we give an answer that maybe it looks like that.
We say, it's really wonderful to travel, and also incredible power to work with creative people, resourceful, passionate people.
And all of that is true, but it's just a part of what happens, because what we never say in front of the cameras, what I never said in front of them, is: I'm insecure.
And I'm because I have to worry about my life every day.
And if you ever ask yourself, with some more thin legs and the brightest hair will be happier.
They only have to meet with a group of models, because they have the most thin legs and the brightest hair and the most to fashion -- but probably the most insecure women on the planet.
But especially it was hard to analyze a situation of racial oppression and gender when I'm one of the biggest benefits.
If there is something that will come from this talk, I hope you all feel more comfortable when you recognize the power of the image in perception that we have of success and failure.
Thank you.
The photograph has been my passion since I was older enough to put a camera, but today I want to share with you my 15 most precious pictures -- and I didn't get me who took them.
There were no artistic directors, no stations, no opportunity to repeat photos, not even a minimum care in lighting.
In fact, most people took them at random.
My story starts when, in New York City in New York to give a poster, my wife took me this picture holding my daughter at the day of his first birthday. That's the cover of the 57 and the five of them.
He gave the chance that we went back to New York just a year later, so we decided to take the same picture.
Well, you know what comes now.
When the third birthday of my daughter, my wife told me, "Why don't you take you to San York in a healthy journey and continue the ritual.
This is when we started asking tourists that were going to take us out of the picture.
It's amazing that the gesture of delivering the camera to a complete unknown is so universal.
No one has never been denied and fortunately, no one has ever heard of the camera.
So we were not aware of how much of this journey would change us.
It became a sacred thing for us.
This picture is a few weeks after 9/11, and I had to explain to my daughter what had happened that day that a five-year-old could understand it.
These pictures are much more than representations of a concrete moment or a specific journey.
They're also a way of stopping time in a week of October and making us reflect about our time and our evolution over the years, and not just at the physical level, but in all ways.
Because although we always take the same picture, our perspective changes, my daughter brings new stories, and I can see life through his eyes and how it perceives and interacts with everything.
That time in concrete that we spend together is something that we hope with illusion all year.
Recently, in one of the travel, we were walking on, when suddenly he stood up in dry and pointed out a red tone of the wrist store that was loved with a little bit of visionary vision.
And he described me what had felt like five years of foot in that same place.
I began to remember his heart paralyzed with force to see that place for the first time nine years ago.
And now what you look at in New York are universities, because it's decided to study in New York.
And suddenly I understood that one of the most important things we create are the memories.
So I want to share the idea of engaging actively in the conscious creation of memories.
I don't know you, but apart from these 15 pictures, I don't go out in many of the family pictures.
I'm always the one who gets the picture.
Today I want to encourage you all to appear in the picture, and they don't want to get to someone and ask them, does it get a picture of us?
Thank you.
I'd like to talk about a very special group of animals.
There are 10,000 species of birds in the world.
The buses are in the most threatened birds.
First of all, why do they have so bad press?
It's also been associated with Disney laughter as measured characters, dumb characters, stupid.
More recently, if you've been following the rain Kenyan press, applause and allegal academics, these are the attributes that associate with the Kenyan Parliament. But I don't accept it.
I don't accept it. You know why?
Because the members of the Parliament don't keep clean the environment --  -- the parliament doesn't help prevent disease radiation.
They are hardly months.   They are far away.  And my favorite, the goods have better presence --   There are two kinds of dogs on this planet.
There are the New World Bush guides that are mostly found in the Americas, like the controls and the cards, and the old World Bush, where we have 16 species -- of these 16, 11 face a high risk of extinction.
So why are the fundamentals important? First of all, provide violent ecological services -- clean.
They are our natural garbage programs.
They clean the boards to the bone.
They help kill all of the bacteria, they help absorb the anthrax that of not being for them and causing big losses of livestock and diseases in other animals.
Recent studies have shown that in areas where there are no goods, the boards take three to four times longer to declare, and this has huge ramifications in disease radiation.
The bus also has huge historical importance.
They've been associated with the ancient Egyptian culture.
Jeverite was the symbol of the prototype and the maternity and, along with the coat, symbolized the unit between the high and the Dependence Egypt.
In the Hindu mythology. Jack was the god god, and he risked his life to save the god Sirol from the 10 heads of Raisual head.
In the Tibetan culture, they are done by very important energy entrepreneurs in places like the Tibet -- there is no place to bury the dead, or wood to create them, so these goods provide a natural disposal system.
What's the problem with the four folks?
We have eight species of fundamental guys in Kenya, which six are in extreme threatened extinction.
The reason is that they're being poisoned -- and the reason they're being poisoned is because there are conflicts between humans and favorite. Passenger communities use this venom against predators, and as a consequence, the goods are victims of this.
In South Asia, in countries like India and Pakistan, four species of funding are on the critical list of extinction, which means that in less than 10 or 15 years, they will be extinct, and the reason is because they fall out of the winning consumption that has been treated with an analog drug like Dick.
This drug has been banned for veterinary use in India, and they've taken a position.
Since there are no goods, there has been a spread in the number of street dogs in breast rains, and when you have street dogs -- you have a huge bomb of time for radio. The number of cases of rage has increased enormously in India.
Kenya is going to have one of the biggest wind parks in Africa, 375 planes are going to be above the Turkey lake.
I'm not against wind energy, but we have to work with governments, because wind turbines do this to birds. They cut them in half.
They're birds of birds.
In West Africa, there is a horrible commercial trade to serve the brown and the physical market.
So what is being doing? Well, we're investigating these birds. We're putting them transparent.
We're trying to determine their basic ecology, and see where they go.
We can see that they travel for different countries, so to focus on a problem that's completely not going to serve anything.
We have to work with governments at the regional level.
We're working with local communities.
We're talking to them about appreciating the goods, about the need to appreciate these wonderful creatures and services that they produce.
How can you help? It can become active -- you can do noise. You can write a letter to your government and tell them, we have to focus on these very understanding creatures -- donate their time to spread the word -- spread the word.
When they come out of this room, they will report to the four, but they talk to their families, with their children, with their neighbors on the goals.
They are very elegant. Charles Darwin said that he changed the opinion because he saw them flying without effort, no energy spending in the heavens.
Kenya, this world, will be much more poor without these wonderful species.
Thank you very much.
Every thing I do and everything I do -- my life -- it's been shaped by seven years of work during my youth in Africa.
Since 1974, to 1977, young light, but I am not --  I worked in Zambia, Kenya, Costa of Maria, Argentina and Somalia -- in technical cooperation projects with African countries.
I worked for an Italian NGO and every project we established in Africa.
And I was performed.
I thought, at the age of 21, that the Italians were good people, and we were doing a good job in Africa.
Instead of that, everything we did is we used it.
Our first project, the one that inspired my first book, "And "Alless the Zambia," was a project where the Italians decided to teach the people from Zambia.
So, we got Italian seeds to the south of Zambia.
Of course, people were not at all interested in doing that, so we paid them to come to work, and sometimes they didn't get accountable.  We were amazed that local people, in so fertile valley, had not had agriculture.
However, instead of asking them how it was possible that they didn't grow anything, we just said, "Thank God we're here."  Just as long to save people in Zambia people."
And of course, everything in Africa was grown up.
We got these magnificent tomatoes -- in Italy, a tomato would grow this size in Zambia.
And we couldn't believe it, we were telling the Bankshania, "Look at how easy agriculture is.
When the tomatoes were beautiful, ladies and red, overnight. At night in the morning, about 200,000 specialists appeared from the river and ate everything.  And we said to the vastly, "Oh my God, we have them."
And the animals said, "Yes, that's why we don't have agriculture here."  "Why didn't they say that? You never asked.
I thought we only ate the Elas in Africa, but then I saw what Americans did, what the English did, what the English did, what the French did, and after seeing what they were doing, I felt pretty proud of our project in Zambia.
Because, as you see, at least we feed the spirits.
You should see the waste --  You should see the waste that we gave them to the trusted people in Africa.
I want to read a book, read a Death Harvard, economic "Hurricane."
The book was published in 2009.
We, Western donors -- we've handed the African continent two million dollars in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you about the damage that the money has caused you.
Just read your book.
I'll read it from an African woman, the damage we've done.
The Westerners are imperialistics, colonial missionary, and we treat people only in two ways or pathogens, or we're paralyzed.
The two words come from the Latin Latin Rat, which means parent."
However, they mean two different things.
Patients, I treat any of a different culture as if they were my sons, "I want a lot of it."
Pathogen, I treat all of a different culture as if they were my services.
So the whites in Africa are called "Bond: one.
That book gave me a slap in the face. "The little thing is beautiful, written by Schatland, who said about all economic development, if people don't want to be help, you leave them alone.
This should be the first principle of aid.
The first principle of aid is to respect it.
This morning, the gentleman who opened this conference put a pole on the ground and said, "Can you imagine a city that's not neuroscience?
I decided 27 years to just respond to people, and I invented a system called Facebook Facebook where you never start anything, you ever motivate anyone, but it becomes a service of local passion, the service of local people who have the dream of becoming a better person.
So what do you do? It's shut up.
It has never come to a community with an idea, and it sits with the people of the local.
We don't work from offices.
We met in a coffee coffee. We met in a bar.
We have zero infrastructure.
And what do we do? We become friends, and we find out what the person wants to do.
The most important thing is passion.
You can give somebody an idea.
If that person doesn't want to do that, what is you going to do?
The passion that she has for his own growth is the most important.
The passion that man has for his own personal growth is the most important.
And then, we helped them find knowledge because no one in the world can succeed alone.
The person with the idea may not have knowledge, but knowledge is available.
So years and years ago, I had this idea: Why not we, for once instead of getting to a community to tell people what to do, why not once -- we hear them? But not in community meetings.
I'll tell you a secret.
There's a problem with community meetings.
The entrepreneurs never support, and they will never tell you, in a public meeting, what they want to do with their own money, what opportunity they have.
So, planning has this blind point.
The smartest people in their community, you don't even know them, because they don't have their public meetings.
What do we do? We work one to one, and we work face to face, you have to create social infrastructure, which doesn't exist.
You must create a new profession.
The profession is the family of the company, the family physician doctor, who is set up with you in your house, at the table of your kitchen, in the coffee, and that helps you find the resources to transform its passion in a way of winning life.
I started this as a test in hope, city of Western Australia.
I was making a Ph.D. at that time, trying to get away from this driver garbage that we came to tell them what to do.
In a year, I had 27 projects, and the government came to see to ask, "How can you do that?
How can you do it? And I said, "I did something very, very, very hard.
I shut up and listened to them --   So the government says, "Hello back again."  We've done it in 300 communities in the world.
We've helped 40,000 businesses.
There is a new generation of entrepreneurs that are dying of loneliness.
Peter Drug, one of the greatest business aspects of history, passed at 96 years ago.
Peter Drug was a philosophy professor before involved in business, and this is what Peter Drug says, "The planning is actually incompatible with a society and an innovative company economy.
planning is the kiss of the death of the corporate spirit.
So now you are rebuilding Christian without knowing what the highest people in Christian want to do with their own money and their own energy.
You have to learn how to get these people to be able to talk to you.
You have to offer them conflict, privacy has to be fantastic when you help them, and then you will argue, you will come into mass.
In a community of 10,000 people, we got 200 customers.
Can you imagine a community of 400,000 people, intelligence and passion?
What do you present in this morning more this?
The local people. That's what you have clapping.
So, what I tell you is that the entrepreneurial spirit is where it is.
We're at the end of the first industrial revolution -- fully renewables -- manufacturing -- and from one moment to another, we have systems that are not sustainable.
The internal combustion engine is not sustainable.
The fall as a way of holding machinery is not sustainable.
What we need to consider is how we number, we cure -- we education, we translate, we communicate seven billion people, in a sustainable form.
There are no technologies to do that.
Who is going to invent technology for green revolution -- the colleges? Forget it."
Government? Forget it."
They'll be the entrepreneurs and they're doing it now.
There's an amazing story that I read in a future magazine many, many years ago.
There was a group of experts that were invited to debate the future of New York City in the 1860s.
And in the 1860s, this group of people came together, and they spread about what would happen to New York City in 100 years, and the conclusion was unique: New York City wouldn't exist within 100 years.
Why? Because they analyzed the curve and they pointed out, if the population keeps growing up at this rate, to transplant the population of New York to the around, they would require six million horses, and the manure produced by six million horses would be impossible to work.
They were already adding in star.  And therefore, in 1860, they were doing this dirty technology that would work New York life.
So what happens? In the next 40 years, in 1900, the United States appeared 100 automatic manufacturing companies, 100.
The idea of finding a different technology was absolutely absorbed and there were very few stations, stations, factories in apart places.
Destrum, Michigan. Henry Ford Henry Ford Here.
However, there is a secret to work with entrepreneurs.
First of all, you have to offer them conflicts.
Otherwise, you won't come to talk to you.
Then, you have to offer them an absolute thing, dedicated service, a whole service of it.
And, eventually, you will have to tell you the truth with respect to understand.
The smallest company, the biggest company, has to be able to do three things: the product that you want to sell to you has to be fantastic, you have to count with a fantastic marketing, and you have to count a fantastic financial administration.
Guess what?
We've never met a single human being in the world that can do, sell and look for the money alone.
It doesn't exist.
This is still not born.
We've researched and looked at the 100 iconic companies of the Carnegie world, Western, Edison -- all the new companies, Google, Am.
There's only one thing that all successful companies in the world have in common, only one: no one was started by one person.
I would never word me, but the word "We "Do, 32 times.
He wasn't just when he began.
Nobody starts a company alone. No one.
So we can create the community where we have factories, who are coming from a small business environment sitting in careers, in bars next to their dedicated devices who are going to do for you, what someone did for this gentleman who talks about this epidemic, someone who will ask you, what does it need?
What can you do? Can you do it?
Okay, can you sell it? Can you look for the money?
"Oh, no, I can't do that. I want you to look for somebody looking for somebody for someone?
We activate communities.
Thank you.
The people who surround us can help us in a lot of ways to improve our lives.
We don't know all the neighbors, so we don't really exchange a lot of knowledge even though we can share the same public spaces.
In the last few years, I've tried to share more with my neighbors in public space, simple tools like authors, plants and chalk.
These projects came from questions like, how much do my neighbors pay for your apartment?
How can we pay and ask more things without calling the door in a bad moment?
How do you share more memories of our abandoned buildings and understand our landscape?
How do we share our hopes to the empty stores so that our communities can reflect our needs and dreams?
I live in New Orleans, and I'm in love with New Orleans.
My soul always finds relief with giant robots that give shadows to love, rates and spaces for centuries and trust in a city.
 It's a password in New Orleans.  The city has one of the most beautiful architects in the world, but also one with the largest amount of abandoned properties.
I live near this house and I thought about how I could turn it into a more enjoyable space for the neighborhood, and also in something that changed my life forever.
In 2009, I lost someone who loved a lot.
It was Joan as a mother for me.
His death was sudden and unexpected.
I thought a lot about death.
And this led me a profound gratitude for the time of life.
He gave clarity to the meaningful things of my current life.
But I propose to keep this look at my everyday life.
I think it's easy to let me go through the day and forget what's really important for one.
So with the help of old and new friends transformed the wall of this house abandoned on a giant blackboard, and he painted on her sentences to say, "Before I die I want.
So the trains could take a disturb, reflect about their lives and share personal aspirations in public space.
I didn't know what to wait for this experiment but the next day the wall was full and kept covering it.
And I'd like to share some things that people wrote on the wall.
Before I died, I want to be judged by poet!  Before I die I want to sit on the date line of the date change."
Before I died, I want to sing for millions of people."
Before I die I want to plant a tree."
Before I died, I want to live outside the network.
Before I died, I want to hug it once again."
Before I die I want to go to the rescue of somebody's response."
Before I die I want to be completely myself."
This abandoned space became constructive and the dreams and hope of people made me laugh at cards, they destroyed me, and they gave me a bit of comfort in hard times.
It's about knowing that you're not alone. It's about understanding our neighbors in new ways and exploitations -- it's about empowering reflection and contact, and remembering what is most important to us as we grow up and change.
This happened last year, and I started getting hundreds of messages of passionate people who wanted to make a wall in their community.
So with my colleagues in the civic center, we did a kit and now they've been done in countries around the world, like Karachia, South Africa, Australia, Argentina and beyond.
Together, we showed the power of our public spaces if they give us the opportunity to express and share each other.
Two of the most valuable things we have is time and our relationships with other people.
In our age of distribution increasing, it's more important than ever, finding ways to preserve the perspective and remember that life is brief.
death is something that we often avoid talking about, or even thinking, but I understood that preparing for death is one of those things that trust us more power.
You think of the clarify of our life.
Our shared spaces can reflect better what matters better as individuals and as a community and more media to share hope, fears and stories, the people around us not only can help improve places, can help improve our lives.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I have a only request today.
Please don't tell me I'm normal.
Now I'd like to introduce you to my brother.
Remember is 22 years old, it's high and very cool.
It doesn't talk about, but it transforms better than some of the best speakers.
She knows what love is.
I'm going to share it in including what happens.
It's not amazing. It doesn't look at the color of the skin.
They don't care about religious differences and look at this: it has never lied.
When I sing the songs of our childhood, trying to make words of those I couldn't even me, I remember one thing: how little we know about the mind and how wonderful the unknown should be.
Samuel is 16 years old. It's high. It's very cool.
He owns the most impossible memory.
However, it's a selective memory.
It didn't remember if I stole my chocolate, but I remember the year that each of the songs of my iPod came out, conversations that we kept when I was four years old, I was able to stand on my arm during the first episode of the Telescopes and the Lower Gaga birthday.
Do you don't think amazing?
But most people don't agree.
And in fact, because their minds are not adjusted to the concept of normal society, they're often ignored and understanding.
But what I propelled to my heart and strength my soul was that even if that was the case, even though they didn't consider them within the order, that could only mean one thing: they were extraordinary and autistic and extraordinary.
Now, for those less familiar themselves with the term autism, it's a complex brain disorder affecting social communication, learning and sometimes to physical skills.
In every individual is manufactured differently, from there that Remember is so different to Sam.
And around the world, every 20 minutes, it's diagnosed a new case of autism, and even though it's one of the disorders of development that is faster in the world, there is no cause, no known cure.
I don't remember my first encounter with autism, but I don't remember one day without him.
I was only three years old when my brother came to the world, and I was very excited about having a new self in my life.
When a few months, I realized that he was different.
He was a lot.
I didn't want to play like the other babies and in fact, it didn't seem very interested in me at all.
She lived in his own world, and he was reinventing in his own world, and he found pleasure in the smallest things, like putting the cars on line around the room, looking at the washing machine, and eating anything that would be in between.
As it grew up, it became more different, and the differences became more evident.
But beyond the red records, frustration and infectious hyper-locker, there was something really unique, a pure and innocent nature, a child who saw the world without pressures, a human being that I had never lied.
Extraordinary.
I can't deny that there have been some hard moments in my family, moments that I would have wanted that they were just like me.
But I look back at things that have taught me about individuals, communication and love, and I realize that they're things that I wouldn't want to change for normal.
Now normal is the beauty that gives us the differences, and the fact of being different doesn't mean that some is wrong.
It just means there's a different view of what's right.
If I could convey one thing to Queen and Sam and to you, it would be you don't have to be normal.
They can be extraordinary.
Because, autistic or not, the differences we have, are a dono." Every one of us has a gift in your inner and, frankly, the pursuit of normal is the last sacrifice of potential.
The opportunity for grand, progress and change dies at the time where we try to be like others.
Please don't tell me I'm normal.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I experienced a little bit what should have been Alice in the Marine country.
Penn State asked me, a communications teacher, who gave a communications class to engineering students.
I was scared.  scared of truth -- scared from these students with his big minds -- his big books and their big words and unknown words.
But by developing those conversations, I felt what Alice should have felt when he fell through the hole of the rabbit and saw the door of a new world.
I just felt when I had those conversations with the students, and I was surprised by the ideas that they had, and I wanted others to experience this wonderful world.
And I think the key to opening that door is a big communication.
We need a huge communication of our scientists and engineers to change the world.
Our scientists and engineers are the ones that are attacking our larger challenges, from energy to environment and health care, among others, and if we don't understand this, the work is not done, and I think it's our responsibility as not scientists to have these interactions.
But these big conversations can't happen if our scientists and engineers don't invite us to see their wonderful world.
So scientists and engineers, please tell us with simplicity.
I want to share some suggestions about how you can do it to make sure that the science is sexy and that its engineering is attractive.
First question to say, and then what?
Tell us why science is relevant to us.
They don't just tell us that they study the trade, but they study the translations, which are the mesh structure of our bones because it's important to understand and treat observations.
And when they're describing their science, care with the jargon.
The record is an obstacle for our understanding of their ideas.
Sure, you can say "space and temporary, but why not say "space and time that is much more accessible to us?
To make them accessible is not the same as making them total.
Instead, as Einstein said, that everything is as simple as possible, but not simple.
You can clearly communicate their science without committing ideas.
Something to consider is to use examples, stories and analogies -- they're ways to deceive and excited with their content.
And when you present their work, forget about the signs of balance."
You have wondered why they call the balance?  What do the balances do? The bullets kill and kill their presentation.
A film like this is not only boring, but it's really supported in the language area of our brain and adds us.
So instead, this example of examples of Gene Brown is a lot more effective -- it shows that the special structure of translations is so strong that it really inspired the unique design of the Eiffel Tower Tower.
The trick here is to use a simple sentence, lighting, that the public can understand if you lose a little bit, and then provide graphs that exploit our other senses and create a deeper sense of understanding what is described to.
I think these are just some key things that can help each other, and we see the country of wonders that are science and engineering.
And so, scientists and engineers, when they have solved this equation, for all the media --  Thank you.
One of my favorite words all over the Oxford English dictionary is "Triangle."
Just because it sounds very well.
And "Turkey" means "Department Police."
Although there was a 20th-century peripheral editor that was defined by a lot better when he said, "A nerd is the one who looks for a public burden without matter or platform or principle, and that, when you win, you get it for the mere use of a refugee more refugee?
I have no idea what it means "recording."
Something that I do with words, I guess.
It's very important that words are the basis in politics, and that all politicians know they have to try to dominate the language.
It wasn't until for example, 1771 that the British Parliament allowed newspapers to quote the exact words that were said in the parliamentary chamber.
And this whole thing was because of the courage of a guy with the name of the name of Brad Church, who faced the Parliament Campaign.
He got in the London Tower and they commissioned him, but he had enough courage to face them, and at the end he had such popular support in London that won.
And just a few years later, we had the first recorded use of the phrase "That's "shortly "grades)
Most people think it's linear.
It's not. It's because of the freedom of expression.
But to really show you how words and politics interact, I want you to come back to the United States, right after independence.
So they had to address the question of how to call George Washington, his leader.
They didn't know.
How do you call the leader of a Republican country?
This was made in Congress for a long time.
All kinds of suggestions they could have fruit.
Some of them wanted to call it "Jessiciet de State Washington: and others, "The Air George Washington: And other Lesters of the U.S. People in the U.S.
Not very attractive.
Some of you just wanted to call it "Richard."
They thought it was a quality of quality.
And even with it were monopoly, they had the idea that you could be elected king for a certain term.
And I could have served it.
Everybody gets tired of it, because this debate was promoted for three weeks.
I read a poor silk day, and he always wrote, "I still have this topic.
What caused the portrait and the height was that the House of Representatives was against the Senate.
The House of Representatives didn't want Washington to complete power.
They didn't want to call it King in case he gave him to him or her society ideas.
So they wanted to give it the most modest title, more inflationate and more unlikely that they came to them.
And that title was President."
President. They didn't invent the title, but it only meant somebody who wants a meeting."
It was like the president of a jury.
And I didn't have much more grand than the term "approach or "Spring."
There were effective presidents of small colonial tools and government, but it was really an infinite title.
And so the Senate was operating.
They said, "It's ridiculous, we can't call it President."
"This guy has to sign treated and meet with foreign diagnostics."
"And who will be serious with a standard and infinite title as president of the U.S.
And finally, after three weeks of debate, the Senate didn't.
We can learn three interesting things about all this.
First of all, and this is my favorite to where I've been able to figure out, the Senate has never really reported the President title.
President Barack Obama is lucky to follow there, waiting for the Senate to be in action.
The second thing that we can learn is that when a government says that a measure is temporary --  -- we can keep waiting for 32 years more.
But the third thing we can learn, and this is the most important thing, and with this, I want to leave you -- is that the U.S. President of the United States doesn't sound so modest today, right?
Especially if you have more than 5,000 nuclear heads at stake, the largest economy in the world and a fleet of armed air vehicles and so on.
reality and history have caused the title of gravity.
So at the end you won the Senate.
They got their title of responsibility.
And also the other concern of the Senate, the appearance of silence, well, was a uniqueness by then.
But do you know how many nations are now president?
And everything because they want to sound like the guy who has the 5,000 nuclear heads and so on.
So in the end, the Senate won and the House of Representatives lost because nobody is going to feel humble when you tell them that they're now the president of the U.S.
And I think that's the great lesson that we can learn, and I would like to leave you with.
politicians try to choose and use the words to shape and control reality, but actually the ability to really change the words that these could change reality.
Thank you very much.
I'm 45 feet under land in an illegal mine in Ghana.
The air is loaded with heat and dust, and it's hard to breathe.
I feel the rock of sweat bodies in the dark, but I can't see much more.
I hear voices that talk about, but above all, that card of male towers and stones that are printed with primitive tools.
Like others, I carry a cheap linear light of light subject to my head with this administration electronic, and I can barely distinguish the branches of that hole of a meter that takes hundreds of meters on Earth.
I was selling my hand and suddenly I remember a minister that I met days before, who lost control and fell into the face of the people in that game.
As I talk to you today, these men are in the depth of that hole risking their lives without paying or rewards and often dying.
I went out of that hole and I went home, but they may never do it, because they're prey of slavery.
In the last 28 years, I was documenting native cultures in over 70 countries in six continents, and in 2009, I had the great honor to be the only device in the Vancouver Peace Summit of the Venezuela.
Among all the amazing people I met there, I met an interactive of "Farm the Salms," an NGO that's dedicated to eradicate modern slavery.
We started talking about slavery and, really, I started learning about slavery because I knew that there was in the world, but not that grade.
When we finished talking, I was really ashamed to ignore this atheist of our days and I thought, if I don't know, how many people don't know it?
I was made out of the stomach and weeks later, I flew to Los Angeles to meet the Savage of "Space and offer my help.
I started my journey to modern slavery.
Interestingly, I've been in many of these places.
Some of them, even I considered them my second home.
But this time, I would sell the dirty tricks.
A conservative calculation says that there are now over 27 million people in the world.
It's twice the amount of Africans displaced throughout the transparent slave trafficking.
150 years ago, the cost of an agricultural slave was about three times the annual salary of an American worker.
The equivalent of about 50,000 dollars today.
However, today you can enslave the whole families of the entire devices of 18 dollars.
Amazingly, slavery generates profits from over 13 billion dollars a year around the world.
Many have been fooled with false promise of good education and better work to then discover that they're forced to work without pay, under threat of violence and can't escape.
Now slavery operates in the trade, goods produced by slaves have value, but who produce them are disappeared.
slavery exists in almost everybody and yet it's illegal around the world.
In India and Nepal, I met the horizons of bricks.
This strange and formidable show was like entering the ancient Egypt or the hell of Dan.
In a temperature of 54 degrees C, men, women, children, in fact, entire families wrapped up in a heavy store of dust -- they're mechanically stacked in their heads to 18 at the time, and they take them from the adult furnaces to trucks that are hundreds of meters.
The monkey and the candidate work in silence, doing this task over and over again for 16 or 17 hours a day.
There were no parents to eat, and not to drink, and the severe seal would make it pretty intrinsical.
So paralyzed was the heat and the dust that my camera became too hot to the touch, and stopped working.
Every 20 minutes, I had to run the car to clean the team and make it work with an air conditioning to revive it, and sitting there, I thought, my camera gets a much better treatment than these people.
Back in the furnaces I wanted to cry, but the abstraction I was on my side quickly grabbed me and said, "Listen, don't do it. Don't do it."
And it explained to me very clearly that demonstrate emotions is very dangerous in places like this, not just for me, but for them.
I couldn't offer them any direct aid.
I couldn't give them money, nothing.
I was not a citizen of that country.
I could put them in a worse situation than they were already gone.
I had to trust "Mars the Sunshines and work inside the system for his release, and I trusted that they would get it.
In terms of me, I waited to get home to feel my heart destroyed.
In the Himalayas, I found children dragging rocks for miles per mile through marks that were waiting down.
Those big planks were more heavy than the kids who charge them and children put them into their heads with savings made out of steel, ropes and hands.
It's hard to present something so overwhelming to it.
How can we influence something so indistance, but so concrete?
Some people don't even know they're slaves -- and they work 16 or 17 hours a day without paying -- because this has been all their life.
They have nothing to compare to.
When these villages took their freedom, the slaves were completely burned their houses.
When we heard the word slavery often we thought about sexual traffic, and because of this global awareness I was warned that it would be hard for me to work with security in this particular business.
In Katrina I was accepted women who had been previously sexually slaves.
I was driven by a couple of angels that were giving this dirty basement, of the forest light.
It wasn't exactly a bomb.
It was rather a restaurant.
Restorability, as you know in the office, are local for forced prostitution.
They have small rooms, private rooms, where the women with their girls and children, some of just seven years old, are forced to train clients and encourage them to buy more food and alcohol.
Each place is dark and successful, identified by a painted number on the wall and divided by a biomass and a curtain.
Workers often suffer sex abuse by hands of their clients.
From foot in the pandemic, I remember having felt a fear of an ardent adding and in that instant, I could barely imagine what it should be stuck in that hell.
I only had a coming out, the stairs where I came in.
There were no back doors.
There were no windows big enough to train.
Those people don't have a school, and because we play such a difficult topic, it's important to point out that slavery even sexual traffic happens around us.
There are hundreds of people enslaved in agriculture, in restaurants in the domestic service and the list can continue.
Recently, the New York Times reported that between 100,000 and 300,000 American children are sold every year as sex slaves.
It happens everywhere, but we don't see it.
Textiles are another activity that we often relate to the slave labor.
I visited Indian villages where there were entire families enslaved in the silk trade.
This is a family.
The hands of black are from the father, blue tissue and red, from their children.
They mix headlines in these big barrels and dip silk in liquid to the elbow, but the ink is toxic.
My introduction told me their stories.
"We don't have freedom, they said.
We still hope, though, can come out of this house someday and go to another place where we really pay our work."
It's estimated that there are more than 4,000 children in slavery in the Valley, the largest artificial lake in the world.
When we arrived, I went to take a quick look.
I saw what seemed to be a fish family in a boat, two older siblings, some younger kids, makes sense of it?
Wrong. They were all slaves.
Children are separated from their transported families, disappeared and forced to work extensive steel on these boats in the lake, despite not knowing anything.
This child is eight years old.
When our boat came up was teaming out, it feared that his little canoe was pregnant.
I was paralyzed by fear of falling into water.
The branches of the tree trees in Lake Volunteer often attract networks and children and photographers and fear, they're thrown into the water to unleash the branches.
Many are dropping.
Since remember, it's always been forced to work on the lake.
For fear of his love is not going to flee out, and like all life has been treated with credit, it is clearly treating the younger slaves under their command.
I met these guys at five o'clock in the morning, when the last networks, but they had been working from the one.
On the cold and windy night.
And it has to point out that these networks weigh over 400 pounds when they're filled with fish.
I want to introduce you to Koba.
Kofi was rescued in a fishing village.
I met it in a shelter in which "Free the Sunshines will be redesigned to slightly victims of slavery.
Kofi symbolizes the possible.
Who will be because someone decided to make the difference in their life?
By driving by a road in Ghana with partners of "Marine the Slows: an abstraction partner with his motorcycle suddenly accelerate and supported our car and played the window.
It asked us to follow it for a dirt path to the forest.
At the end of the way, we went out of the car, and he asked the driver to come out quickly.
Then he pointed out this feeling just visible, and he said, "This is the way, this is the way. Come on.
As we started going down, we took the experiments that blocked the road, and after walking about an hour, we found that the path was encouraged by the recent rain, so I put the pictures of pictures on my head as we go down into these waters to the chest.
After two hours of roads, the silk path ended up openly in a clear, and we had a mass of holes that could fit in a football field, and all of them were full of elaborate workers.
A lot of women had children tied up to their backs, and as they were looking for gold, they were walking in the waters who were sent in the market.
The market is used in the process of extraction.
These miners are enslaved in a wells somewhere in Ghana.
When they came out of the pump, they were packed in their own sweat.
I remember looking at his eyes tired, irrationally, since many had been under land for 72 hours.
The wells have up to 90 meters, and these people are carrying heavy heavy bags that then will be transported to another area that they will be transported to be able to extract the gold.
At first sight, the site seems to be filled with strong men and virginity but if you look closer at it, the margin we see to work for other lucky and also children.
They're all victims of injuries, disease and violence.
In fact, it's very likely that this muscle is going to end up like this victim of tuberculosis and the market by market in a few years.
This is Mangara. When his father died, he took him to work with him in the mines.
By dying his uncle, Manua inherited the debt of the uncle that forces it to be slave in the mines.
When I met it, he had worked in the mines 14 years and the injury of the leg that you see here is a product of an accident in the mine, so serious that doctors said that it should be atophing.
In addition to that, Mangara has tuberculosis, and it's not obvious to that, it's forced to work night and day in that mine.
Yet, he dreams with being released and educated with help of local activists like "Farmer the Sunshines, and it's this kind of determination, from face to a remote possibility, which inspires me a lot of respect.
I want to throw light on slavery.
They knew that their images would be seen by you around the world.
I wanted you to know that we will take testimony of them, and we will do everything possible to help change their lives.
I certainly think that if we can see each other as human beings, then it becomes very difficult to tolerate atrocities like slavery.
These images are not from magazines -- they're from people, real people, like you and I, who deserve the same rights, dignity and respect in your lives.
There's no day that I don't think of these beautiful people, male people, which I've had the great honor to meet.
I hope these images wake up a force in which you see them, in people like you, and I hope that that force goes on a fire and that fire shine light on slavery because, without that light, the beast of slavery can continue to live in the shadows.
Thank you very much.
I do math app and there's a peculiar problem for whom it does, we are like management consumption.
Nobody knows what the hell we do.
So today I'm going to try and explain to you what I do.
The dance is one of the most human activities.
And we got rid of the virgin virgins and the clapping dancers -- that we will see later.
But the ball demands a degree of extraordinary training, a high level of dexterity and probably certain initial attitude that can well have a genetic component.
Sadly, neural disorders like Parkinson's evil destroy this extraordinary ability, as it does with my friend Jane Street who, at his time, was a virtual ballet dance.
In the last few years it's been progress in treatment.
However, there are six million people in the world who are sick, and they have to deal with an incurable debate, temperatures, stiffness and other symptoms of this disease, so we need objective tools to detect disease before it's too late.
We need to be able to measure progress in objective and ultimately, the only way we know if there really is a cure to be when we have an objective and a closing metric drug.
But it's frustrating that for Parkinson's and other disorders of the movement there are no biological markers -- so they don't serve blood analysis and the best thing we have is a neurological exam of 20 minutes.
You have to go to a clinic. It's very, very expensive, and that means that, outside of clinical trials, they never do. It's never done.
And what if patients could do it at home?
That would save a hard journey to clinic. What if patients could do the test themselves.
You don't need to be personal.
By the way, it costs about 300 dollars in neurological clinic.
So what I want to propose to you as no conventional way to try it, you see, in a sense, at least we are all virtual like my friend Jane Street.
This is a video of the vibration of vocal strings.
It shows somebody healthy as they eat sounds when they speak -- we can imagine as a dance of a vocal ballet because we have to coordinate all those vocal organs to produce sounds and we all have the genes needed. The polarization, for example.
And like the ballet -- it requires a level of extraordinary training.
Think about the time that it takes a child to learn to speak.
From sound, we can track the position of vocal strings as vibrate business, and as the Parkinson's affects the limbs also affects vocal organs.
On the bottom line, you can see an example of the irregular temperature of vocal strings.
We see the same symptoms.
vocal temperature, weakness.
The speech becomes more quiet and applaused after a while, and this is an example of symptoms.
How do you compare these tests based on the voice with specialized clinical trials -- well, both of them are invasive.
The neurological test is not invasive -- both use existing infrastructure.
You don't need to design a whole series of hospitals to make them.
They both are precise. Well, but also based on voice are not specialized.
I mean, they can be supported.
They do very quickly, they take about 30 seconds as a lot.
They're minimum cost and we all know what happens.
So when something gets such a low cost, it appears to mass scale.
These are some amazing goals.
We can reduce the logistical difficulties of patients.
I wouldn't need to go to the clinic.
With high-speed monitoring we could get objective data.
We could make massive remarkable recovery for clinical trials, and for the first time, you were completely claim to scale.
We have the opportunity to start looking for the first disease biomass before it's too late.
So when we give the first steps in that sense, we're launching the Partial Vatic Initiative.
Together to Stage and Peters, we want to register a lot of voices around the world to collect enough data and start to tackle these goals.
We have local lines accessible for about 750 million people in the world.
anyone, with or without Parkinson's -- can call under the low price and leave recording for some cents. And I was pleased to announce that we've reached six percent of the goal in only eight hours.
Thank you.   Tom Rielly: So Max, taking all these samples of, let's say 10,000 people, you can say who's healthy and who doesn't?
What will you get from these shows?
Max Litthu, Yeah, yeah. What happens is that during the call you have to indicate whether you have or not the disease. TR: Sure.
MM: You see, some people can not pass it. You may not end it.
But we're going to get a very large sample of data collected in different circumstances, and doing it in different circumstances is important because we're looking for the risk factors in search of the actual markers of disease.
TR: Do you have 86 percent accuracy right now.
MM: A lot more than that.
Actually, my student Thankshee, I have to publish it, has done a fantastic job, and now it's shown that it works on the mobile phone network as well, what you shake the project. We now have 99 percent accuracy.
TR: New and nine. Well, it's an improvement.
MM: Of course.
TR: Thank you very much. Max Lithar audience.
MM: Thank you, Tom.
Before March 2011, I did photographic reports in New York City.
We're parallel creatures, gray.
We hide in the darkness, in four-the-way rooms, and usually we avoid sunlight.
We make the models that are still more thin. The perfect skin, even more perfect we do the impossible, possible and criticize us in the press all the time, but some of us are really artist artist with many years of experience and a real taste for images and photography.
On March 11, 2011, I saw from my house, just like the rest of the world, the tragic events that happen in Japan.
A few time later, an organization where it was voluntary -- there Hans Vanisame, was in the place working as part of the answer team.
I, along with hundreds of other volunteers we knew we couldn't stay at home, so I decided to join the group for three weeks.
On May 13, I traveled to Ourrela.
It's a little village of fishermen located in the Internet presentation of almost 50,000 people, one of the first people affected by the wave.
The water level reached more than 24 feet tall and over three miles in the inside.
As you can imagine, the village was devastated.
We took rubble from the channels and the barriers.
We clean schools. We take the slime. And we leave the right houses to be renovated and redesigned.
We took tons and tons of dead fish forest, designer, power of local factory.
We were analyzed and loved us.
For weeks, both volunteers like neighbors found similar things.
They found pictures and laptops of photos and cameras and DARPA cards.
They all did the same.
Get them back and take them into different places of the village around them to save them.
It wasn't until then I realized that those pictures represented a huge part of the personal losses that people had suffered with.
As long as they were in the wave, and to save their lives, they had to leave absolutely everything they had.
At the end of my first week, I started to help in an assessment center of the village.
He helped clean the common toilets, the huge greatest barriers.
This place turned out to be also the place of the village where the training center picks the photos.
They took them and I had the honor that that day would trust me to clean the photos.
This was exciting and inspiring and I had heard the expression to think beyond the horizon, but it wasn't until I took myself out of my horizons that something happened.
When I looked at the pictures, I found some that were over a hundred years old, some of them still at the top of the lab, I couldn't help to think about how to fix that radio and repair that sand and met hundreds of people who could do the same.
So that night I came into Facebook contact with some of them, and the next morning the answer was so overwhelming and positive. I knew we had to try.
So we started to play the photos.
This was the first of all.
It wasn't too spiritually, but where the water had documented the face of the girl had to deal with a lot of precision and delicate.
Otherwise, that girl would not have the aspect of it, and that would be as tragic as having the photo particularly.
Over time, they arrived for more photos and they needed more reporters so that he came back on Facebook and LinkedIn, and five days later, 80 people in 12 countries were offered to help.
Within two weeks, I had 150 people who were willing to join together.
In Japan, in July, we mobilized Rogele, a neighboring village north of Asia.
Once a week, we used our scanner in the temporary photographic libraries that had been installed where people were going to reclaim their photos.
The time they were going to have to deliver them is a different story, dependent on the present of the photos.
I could mean an hour. I could mean weeks.
It could mean months.
This guy had to draw practically by hand using the areas whose color and detail the water had not destroyed.
It took a long time.
The water destroyed all these pictures underwater in seawater, covered from bacteria, with algae -- even with oil, all along with the time of the time continues to destroy them, so to clean them by hand was an important part of the project.
We couldn't replace the picture unless it was clean and dry and had been recorded by his owner.
We were lucky with the clean person.
We count with the guidance of a remarkable neighbors.
It's very easy to harm the pictures of the picture.
As William, the leader of my group is like making a tattoo.
You can't make mistakes.
The woman who brought us these pictures was lucky to the photos.
He had started to clean them up, but he stopped to realize that he was even more.
I also had dolphins.
Without them, the images of their husband and their own face wouldn't have been able to rebuild. We could blow the images in a single picture and play the whole picture.
When he collected his pictures shared some of his story with us.
Some colleagues from his husband found the pictures in a bomb station between the rubble pretty far away from where their house used to be, but their colleagues recognized it.
The day of the tsunami, his husband was the counterparties of closing the barriers to the wave.
He had to go inside the water as the Syrian sounds sound.
Their small kids, not so small now, but their two children were in school, in different schools.
One of them was stuck in the water.
He took a week to find all his family and know that they had all survived.
The day I gave her pictures his youngest son was 14 years old.
For her, despite all of this, those pictures were the best gift I could do, something that he could go back to look, something that I could remember from the past that would not have been beaten by that day of March when everything in his life changed or was destroyed.
After six months in Japan -- volunteers had joined up there, hundreds of them helped us clean hands over 130,000 photographs -- the big majority -- most of them came back to hands of their owners -- important.
More than 500 volunteers around the world helped us return to 90 families of fully respected and retired pictures of them.
During this time, we don't really spend more than 1,000 dollars in teams and materials, most of them in ink for printers.
We take pictures constantly.
A picture is a memory of someone or something, a place, a relationship, somebody wanted.
They are guards of our memories and stories, the last thing we would take but the first thing we will go back to see.
So about this was the project, to restore small pieces of humanity, to return someone in their connection with the past.
When a picture like this is back to somebody, it's a huge difference in the life of the person that receives it.
This project also made a big difference in the life of reporters.
Some of them were connected to something larger, to return something, using their talent for something that is not thin models of perfect skin.
To conclude, I would like to read this email. I sent it Singapore the day I came back from Japan after six months.
As I was replacing, I couldn't avoid thinking about people and stories shown in images.
One particular picture, a photo with women in different ages from the grandmother to the small child, gathered around a baby, moved around a baby, because a similar picture of my family my grandmother, my mother, I and my daughter was born, hangs out of our wall.
In the entire world, in all of our basic needs are the same, right?
Thank you.
Doctor Edinburgh inspired us to wonder and curiosity with this picture of a bullet that brought an apple into an exhibition of only one million of a second.
But now, 50 years later, we can go a million times faster and see the world not a million or a billion frames per second.
I introduce you a new kind of photograph -- photographer, a new technique so fast that it can create videos in slow motion of light.
And with that, we can create cameras that can see after the corners, beyond the line of vision, or see the inside of the body without using X-rays, and really challenge the idea of cameras.
If I take a laser pointer and turn it up and shut out in a trillion of a second or be, in several fears to create a photo package of just a millimeter wide.
And that photo package -- that photographer, to travel at the speed of light, and again, a million times faster than a common ball.
If we take that balance and this photo package and we shoot on this bottle, how do you spread those photons inside this bottle?
What's the aspect of light in slow camera?
Now, all of this --   remember that all of this happens effectively in less than a national is what takes the light.
But this video is 10 billion times slower so you can see light in motion.
Coca-Cola doesn't add this research.  They have a lot of things in this movie, and it will take this information to show what's going on.
The pulse of our bullet comes into the bottle with a photo package that starts to go through it, and that, inside, starts to disappear.
Part of the light is flattered, it goes to the table, and we started to see these locals.
Many of the photons finally get to the lid and then explode in various directions.
As you can see, there's an air bubble that bounces inside the inside.
At that time, the waves travel through the table, and because of the reflection of the top you see in the bottom of the bottle, after several boxes, the thoughts are focus.
Now, if you take a common and current bullet and make it run the same distance and see it in slow camera to about 10 billion times, how much do you think it would take us to feel that film?
One day? A week? Actually, every year.
It would be a very boring movie --  -- a slow bullet in motion.
And how about testing with dead nature?
You can see the waves that come out of the table, the tomato and the wall.
It's like throwing a stone in a pond.
It's the way nature painted a picture, I thought, from a member at a time, but of course, our eyes see an integral composition.
But if you look at this tomato once again, you realize that, as the light comes out of the tomato -- it's still brilliant. It's not dark.
Why? Because the tomato is mature and the light bounce in its inner and come back after several trillion seconds.
In the future, when this feminist is in your mobile phone, they're going to be able to go to the supermarket and check if the fruit is mature without having to touch it.
Why do we create this camera at MIT?
As a photographer, you know, if we take a picture at low exposure, it comes into very little light.
But we will go a billion times faster than the shortest exposure -- so it will just get some light.
We sent that balance, that photons package -- millions of times, and we recorded over and over again with a very high synchronize, we took those gigabytes of data, and we trained them computerly to create those females that I showed you.
We can take all of those data in crude and process them in interesting ways.
Superman can fly.
Other heroes can become invisible.
And if a new power of a superhero future would allow him to look after the risks?
The idea is that we could throw some light on the door. Remover, into the room, a part is going to reflect on the door, and from there to the camera.
Where we could extract those multiple light bottles.
It's not science fiction. We've already built it.
On the left is our female.
Behind the wall there is a manipulation and we will bounce the light on the door.
After the publication of our article in Nature Combinations.
And a small fraction of the photons will return to the camera but interestingly, in slightly different times.
And as we have a camera that works that quickly, our female, it has unique capabilities.
It has very good temporary resolution, and you can look at the world at the speed of light.
So we know the distances to the door and also to the hidden objects, but we don't know what extent to what distance.
When you project a laser you can record a picture in gross that, you see on the screen, it really doesn't make any sense.
But we're going to take a lot of images like that, tens of images, we'll bring them together and try to analyze the multiple light vegetables, and with that, we can see the hidden object?
Can we see it in 3D?
This is our reconstruction here.
We have things to explore before we get this lab, but in the future, we could create cars that avoid collision with what is around the curve.
Or we could look for survivors in dangerous conditions looking at the light reflected by open windows.
Or we could build punished able to see the inside of the body by serving oxygen, and the same for cardiovas.
But of course, because of tissue and blood this is quite hard, so this is actually a request to scientists so that they start thinking about photographer as a new model of visualization to solve the problems of the next generation.
Just like Doug Edward, he himself a scientist, converted the science in art, an art of plastic photographs.
I realized that all the gigabytes of data that we collect every time they're not just for scientific visualization, but we can.
Create a new form of computational photography with slow camera and color code.
And we look at those waves. Remember, the time between each of those waves is just a few trillion of a second.
But here's something fun.
If you look at the waves under the tappe, these are away from us.
The waves should move to us.
What happens here?
It turns out, as we are recording almost at the speed of light, we have strange effects, and Einstein would have loved to see this image.
The order in which events occur in the world sometimes appears to be in the camera.
By applying the corresponding formation of space and time, we can run this difference.
It's time. Thank you.
Hi. This is my mobile phone.
A cell phone can change life, and it gives you individual freedom.
With a cell phone can photograph a crime against humanity in Syria.
With a cell phone, you can tweet a message and start a protest in Egypt.
With a cell phone, you can record a song to Solot and make it famous.
This is all possible with a mobile phone.
I'm a collar of 1984 and I live in Berlin City.
Let's go back to that moment, to this city.
So here you can see how hundreds of thousands of people were working for a change.
This is the fall of 1989, and imagine if all these people gathered that they protest in a change, they had a cell phone in the pocket.
Who you have a cell phone here?
So let me get it.
Raise your mobile phone, take them out.
Let them get you. An Adam, a Blackberry, woman."
It's a lot. Almost everybody has a mobile phone.
But today I'll talk about me, from my phone, and how I changed life.
I'll talk about this.
These are 35 light lines of information.
Brain data.
Why is that information there?
Because in the summer of 2006, the Commons Commission presented a direction.
The Decease of Determination of Data.
This directive says that every European telephone company, every single Internet protection of all of Europe, has to store a wide range of information from users.
Who calls who, who sends an email to who.
Who sends a text to who.
And if we use the phone, where we are.
All of this information is stored by at least six months, and to two years, in their telephone company or its Internet protection.
And all over Europe, people stood up and said, "We don't want this."
They said they didn't want this data return.
We want the subsidia in the digital age, and we don't want the carriers and the Internet drivers to store all this information about us.
There were lawyers, journalists, priests all said, "We don't want this."
And here you can see about 10,000 people who came out on the streets in Berlin and said, "Electronic, I don't fear.
And some even said this would be the Stage 2.0.
The Stage was the secret police of East Germany.
And I also wondered if this works really work.
Can we store all this information about us?
Every time I use the mobile phone?
So I asked my phone -- Democrat Telecomy, who at that time was the largest telephone company in Germany, who please send me all the information that they had about me.
I asked them once, and I got them back to ask them, and I didn't get a concrete answer. It was all blah blah blah.
But then I said, I want to have this information because you are protecting my life.
So I decided to start a court demand because I wanted to have this information.
But Derartu Telecomy said, no, we're not going to give you this information.
At the end we signed an agreement.
I would remove the demand and they send me the information that I asked.
Meanwhile, the German constitutional tribunal failed the incompatible for the German law of the E.U.
So I got this ugly thing on brown with a CD inside.
And in the CD there was this.
Traveless and five thousand hidden lines of information.
At first I saw them, and I said, well, it's a huge file. Okay.
But after a while, I realized that it's my life.
There are six months of my life in this archive.
It was a little scientist, what should I do with that?
Because you can see where I am, where I spend the night, what I'm doing.
But then I said, I want this information to come out.
I want to make it public.
Because I want to show people what data means.
So, along with Zet Olympic and Opera Data City, we did this.
This is a six-year-old visualization of my life.
You can zoom in and go back and forward.
You can see every step I do.
And you can see how I go from Frank in train to California, and what I often call in the journey.
This is all possible with this information.
That gives a little scary.
But it's not only about me.
It's all about us.
First, there are things like, I call my wife and she calls me, we talk a couple of times.
Then they call me some friends and they call them each other.
And then one called the other, and the other one to the other, and we end up with this big network of communication.
You can see how your people communicate each other to what time they call each other, how long they sleep.
You can see all this.
You can see the centers, the leaders of the group.
If you have access to this information, you can see what society is doing.
If you have access to this information, you can control your society.
This is a model for countries like China and Iran.
This is a model to study the shape of your society, because you know who talks to who, who sends an email to who, all of this is possible if you have access to this information.
And this information is stored at least six months in Europe, and until two years.
As I said at the beginning, imagine if all these people in the streets in Berlin, in the fall of 1989, they had a cell phone in the pocket.
And the Stage would have known who involved in this protest, and if the Stage had known who the leaders were, this would never have happened.
The fall of the Berlin Wall may never have happened.
And, in contrast, neither of the Gore Court.
Because today the state agencies and companies want to store as much information from us as possible inside and outside the web.
They want to have the possibility to follow our lives, and they want to store them forever.
But subsidian and living in the digital age, it's not a contradiction.
But today you have to fight for subsidia.
You have to fight for that every day.
When you go home to tell their friends that privacy is a 21st-century value of the 21st century and it's not going of fashion.
When you go home, tell your representative that only because companies and state agencies can store some information, you don't have to do it.
And if you don't believe me, ask your phone company, what information they store from you.
So in the future, every time you use their mobile phones to remind you that they have to fight the self-definition in the digital age.
Thank you.
Hello HIV/AIDS, what happens?
It's not enough.
Hello HIV/AIDS, what happens?
My name is Maria Zayan, and I'm not a bureaucratic, but I know the doctor that brought me into the world.
I cut my mom six times in six different directions.
As a result, I have brain palsy, so I shake all the time.
Look at it.
It's super-complete.
And Muhammad All.
The P, C, is not genetics.
It's not conflict or it can be found.
No one claimed the uterus of my mother and I didn't hire it, because my parents were cousins, although they are.
It just happens by accidents, like the one that happened to me.
Now, I warn you, I'm not an inspiration source.
It feels bad for me, because at some point in life, they've been willing to be disabled.
Let's go from a ride.
Christmas views, they're in the shopping center, they drive in circles looking for parking and what do you see?
16 empty places for disabled.
And they think, "God, can I be at least a little bit?
Also, I tell you, I have 99 problems, and the P, C, is just one of them.
There was an operation of the operation, I would win the gold medal.
I'm a paleontologist, Muslim, woman, disabled and alive in New Jersey.
If you don't feel better, maybe you should do it.
I'm from Park Certification, in New Jersey.
I always loved my neighborhood and my disease had the same initiatives.
I also love that if I wanted to walk from my house to New York, I could.
A lot of people with brain paralysis don't walk, but my parents don't believe in the "notion."
The mantra of my father was, "You can do it. dance song."
If my three older sisters cleaned up, I cleaned up.
If my three older sisters were going to public school, my parents were demanding to the school system and made sure that I was also out, and if we didn't take all the maximum notes, we all got the sneakers of my mother.
My father taught me to walk at the age of five years putting my grades on his feet and just walking on.
Another technique that I used was to hang a dollar in front of me so that it would take it.
The support I carry inside was very strong.
Yeah. The first day in the kindergarten garden was walking like a bomb camp that has received a lot of copy on.
Growing up there were only six Arabs in my city and were all of the family.
There are now 20 Arabs -- and they remain all of the family.  I think nobody realized that we were not Italian.
This was before 9/11 and that politicians would think appropriate to use "Music to Muslims as a campaign.
The people I grew up with didn't have trouble with my faith.
However, it seemed to be a lot of people dying from hunger during the brand.
I told them that he had enough fat to live three whole months without eating, so to help me get out of the dawn of the air is very easy.
Baby captured in Brown.
Yeah, in Broadway, it's crazy.  My parents couldn't afford physical therapy, so I was sent to dance school.
I learned to dance with players, or I can walk on touch.
I'm from New Jersey, and there we want to be a kid, so if my friends used touch, I too.
And when my friends were going to spend summer vacation on the coast of Jersey, I didn't go.
I spent my summer in a war zone, because my parents feared that if we don't go back to Palestine every summer, we will become Madden.
In summer vacation often my father was trying to get me, so I drank a deer milk -- I was put out of hot corn on my back, I immersed me on the Dead Sea, and I remember the water burned my eyes and thought, "It works, it works.
But the miracle cure was the yoga.
I have to say it's very boring, but before I do yoga was a story company that I couldn't put from foot.
And I can now stand in your head.
My parents reinforce this idea that I could do anything, that no dream was impossible, and my dream was to be on the Hospital General Telescope.
I went to university by the positive discrimination and I got a scholarship for the United States, University of the state of Arizona, because it came in all of the things.
It was like the mass of the theater department.
Everybody loved me.
I did all the least intelligent, I took the maximum note in my classes and also in his classes.
Every time I did a scene from the crystal zoo my teachers were crying.
But I never got a role.
Finally, in my last year, the USA decided to do a work called Veronic Valley in Jackson.
It's a piece of a girl with brain parallel.
I was a girl with cerebral parallel.
So I started screaming to the four winds, "On the end of the paper."
I have brain parallels."
At the end of the free."
Thank God about the end, I am free.
I didn't get the paper.  They gave it to Sheikh Brown.
I went to increase running to the director of the theater department, crying historically, as if someone had killed my cat, and asked why and she told me that because they believed it could not make the stunts of risk.
And I said, "Excuse me, if I can't do the risk stunts -- it can't be the character."
It was a role that I literally had been born and gave it to an act without brain parallel.
college was imitating my life.
Hollywood has a dedicated story of hearing actors without disability for disabled papers.
When I graduated home, I went home, and my first active tour was as a strange in a television.
My dream became true.
And I knew that it would be awful of "Phone friends in a sandwich.
Instead, I stayed there as a vase -- I didn't see me more than the number, and it was obvious to me that report directors didn't hire corporate actors, not white, with disability.
They just hired perfect people.
But there were exceptions to the rule.
I grew up looking at Whole Gold, Residential Barry, Elles, and all these women had one thing in common: they were commander.
And so I made my humor.
In my first tour, I took famous comics from New York to New Jersey, and never forget the face of the first comics that he took when he was at high speed by the New Jersey freeway, with a driver that had brain parallel.
I worked in clubs across the United States, and also in Arabic in the Middle East, without censorship and no sale.
Some people say I'm the first monology in the Arab world.
I never like to reclaim the first place, but I know that they never heard that little decline that says that women are not fun, and they are very fun.
In 2003, my brother of another mother and father, Dean Olympic, and I launched the Federal Comedy Festival in New York City -- now in his 10, year.
Our goal was to change the negative image of the Americans in the media, and at the same time remind them to report that sustainability and Arabic are not situation.
Institute Arabs was much easier than fighting the challenge of the station of disability.
My big opportunity came in 2010.
I was invited by the cable news program by cable behind Keith Sweeton.
I went into a graduate dance, and they dragged me into a study and sat on a wheelchair.
I looked at the director and I said, "Excuse me, can you give me another chair?
She looked at me and she said, five, four, three, two.
And we were live.
So I was clinging to the desk desk to not come out of the screen during the security, and when I finished the interview, it was flat.
At the end I had my opportunity and the passion. I knew they wouldn't invite me.
But not only Mr. Rulenanism came back to invite me, but I was as a full-time participant and I pasted my chair.
Something fun that I learned in direct with Keith Sweetle was that people on the Internet are school.
It is said that kids are crime, but they never made fun of me or a girl or any more.
Suddenly, my Internet disability became a bureaucratic object.
I saw online clips like, "Why does it like?
"Is it retroviral?
And my favorite, "Poet Bombable portrait.
What disease does it have?
We should really run for it."
A comment suggested even that I would add my disability to my career: guy, command, paralyze.
disability is as visual as race.
If someone in a wheelchair can't make Beijing, then Benoit can't make someone in a wheelchair.
The disabled ones are the -- yeah, clapping.
The disabled minority of the world, and the largest minority in the world of entertainment.
The doctors say I wouldn't walk, but I'm here in front of you.
However, having grown with the media, I don't think I was.
I hope that together we can create more positive images of disability in media and in everyday life.
Maybe if there were more positive images, that would make less hate on the Internet.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we still need all the society to teach our children.
My torture travel has led me to very spectacular places.
I came to walk through the red carpet flamed by the diabetes of the Taliban Sun and the summit Court Rubin.
I got to act on a film with Adam Halian and work with my pain, the incredible Dave Matts.
It's going to go around the world saying, "The Arabs have become crazy."
I was convicted in representation of the great state of New Jersey in the 2008.
And I founded "The Children of Masterparts: a charity charity to give kids refugee Paris a little bit of what my parents gave me.
It was the only time my father saw me acting in alive, and I gave this talk to her memory.
Patent paintings."
I call me Masterpart Zayan, and if I can, you can too.
I'd like to tell you a story about a child of a small village.
I don't know her name, but I know his story.
It lives in a small village to South Somalia.
This village is near McDonald.
The drought drives the little village to poverty and the edge of starvation.
No for him there, you go to the big city, in this case, Mozart, the capital of Somalia.
When it comes there, there are no opportunities, no job, no future perspective.
He ended up living in a tent in the city outside of McDonald.
After maybe a year, nothing.
One day it comes up to a gentleman who offers him to take him to lunch -- after dinner, to deliver.
He knows a diagram of people who give him a break.
It gets a little bit of money for it to buy new clothes, money to send home, to your family.
They present a young man.
It's finally home.
A new life begins.
It has a life target.
A beautiful day in McDonald, under a blue sky, is a car bomb.
That kid from that little village with dreams of the great care was suicide terrorism, and that dynamic group of people were to Shaker, a terrorist organization connected to the Qaeda.
So how do the story of a child in a little village trying to fulfill their dreams in the city end with him unlike?
He was waiting for.
I was waiting for an opportunity, waiting for the future, waiting for a future perspective, and this was the first thing that came in.
This was the first thing that gets it from what we call "the waiting period."
And its story is repeated in urban centers around the world.
It's the story of the marginalized, urban young urban young people who trigger riots in Johnson, trigger riots in London, who are looking for something beyond the waiting period."
For young people, the promise of the city, the great dream of the city is the opportunity of work, of jobs, of well-being, but young people don't participate in the prosperity of their cities.
It's often the youth that suffers from the highest unemployment rate.
By 2030, three in five people living in cities will be under 18 years.
If we don't include young people in the growth of our cities, if we don't give them opportunities, the history of the waiting period, the access door to terrorism, to violence, to calories, to be the history of cities two.
And in my hometown, McDonald, 70 percent of the young people are unemployed.
70 percent doesn't work, it doesn't go to school.
They don't do virtually anything.
I went back to McDonald's last month, and I went to visit the Middle Hospital.
I remember being to that hospital accelerated to balances thinking, and if I would never have gone up?
What if I had been forced to be in that same wait?
Would I have become a terrorist?
I'm not really sure of the answer.
The reason I was in McDonald's that month was actually to smell some juvenile leaders in a corporate brain.
I got to about 90 Somali youth leaders.
We sat down, and we had a rain of ideas about the solutions to the big challenges facing the city.
One of the young people in the room was Adam.
He went to Maddam University, graduated.
There was no job, no opportunity.
I remember when he told me, that because it was a graduate university, unemployed, frustrated, was the perfect white for Al Shabaab and other terrorist organizations, to be reconciled.
They were looking for people like it.
But this story takes a different path.
In McDonald, the biggest hurdle to get from point A to B are the streets.
Sensitive war years of civil war have completely destroyed the living system, and a motorcycle can be the easiest way to mobilize it.
You see an opportunity and advanced it.
He started a motorcycle company.
He started waving motorcycle motors to local residents who normally couldn't buy them.
I bought 10 motors, with the help of his family and friends, and his dream is at some point to expand hundreds of motors over the next three years.
Why is this story?
What does it do to this different story?
I think his ability to identify and leverage a new opportunity.
It's the business spirit, and I think the business spirit can be the most powerful tool against the waiting period."
It makes young people to be the creators of the economic opportunities that are looking for so desperately for.
And you can train young people to be entrepreneurs.
I want to talk about a young man who attended one of my meetings, Muhammad Mohammen, a fluid.
I was helping to train some of the young people in the corporate initiative and how to be innovative and how to create a culture of corporate initiative.
In fact, it's the first flower that Modon has seen in more than 22 years, and until recently, Mohammed came up until Mohammed came, if you wanted flowers for your wedding.
If you asked somebody, "When was the last time you saw friends?
For those who grew up during the civil war, the answer would be: Never.
So, Mohamed saw an opportunity.
It started a business company and design company.
He created a farm on the outskirts of McDonald, and he began to grow talents and lights, who said, could survive the hard weather of McDonald.
And it started the flow of flowers for wedding floors, creating gardens in the houses, and the city companies -- and now it's working on the creation of the first public park in Maddell in 22 years.
There are no public parks in McDonald.
He wants to create a space where families, young people, can go together, and as he says, smell the proverbial rose.
By the way, he's not crowds because they use a lot of water.
So the first step is to inspire young people, and in that room, the presence of Muhammad had a really profound impact in the young.
They had never thought about starting a business.
They had thought about working for an NGO, working for government, but their story, their innovation, really had a strong impact about them.
I forced them to look at their city as a place of opportunity.
He encouraged them to believe that they could be entrepreneurs that could be artists of change.
By the end of the day, they already had innovative solutions for some of the biggest challenges facing the city.
They identified business solutions for local problems.
So, inspire young people and create a culture of business spirit is really a big step, but young people need capital to make their ideas reality.
They need expertise and guidance to guide them in the development and put it on their business.
They connect young people with the resources they need, to give them the support they need to move from conception to creation, and they will create catalyst for urban growth.
For me, business spirit is something more than starting a business.
It's to create a social impact.
Mohamed is not simply selling flowers.
I think it's selling hope.
His peace park -- this is how it calls it, when it's created, to transform the way people see their city.
They advertise children from the street to help rent and keep the pictures for him.
He gave them a chance to escape from the paradigm of the waitre of the wait."
These young entrepreneurs are having a tremendous impact in their cities.
So my suggestion is: convert young people in entrepreneurs -- they include and feed their inherent innovation, and they will have more stories about flowers and parks of peace than buses and "Paragraphs of waiting."
Thank you.
I was about 10 years old, and I went to camping with my dad in the Adventing mountains, an area added north in New York State.
It was a beautiful day.
The forest forest.
The sun made the leaves to shine as a violence, and not to be the way that we went on, we could almost pretend that we were the first human beings to spend that land.
We get to our camp.
It was a code in a glass with a beautiful crystal lake when I discovered something horrible.
Behind the code there was a shake, about four square meters with public apple hearts of aluminum paper, and old old paper.
And I was annoyed, and I was very angry, incredibly confused.
The camps that were too lazy to get what they had brought out, who thought it was going to clean their barrier?
That question followed with me, and it was simplified a little bit.
Who clean our barrier?
No matter how the organism or where we put the outstand," who clean our trash in Starbularing?
Who clean our trash in Rio or in Paris or in London.
Here in New York City, the Department of Health Climate our trash -- at 11 thousand tons of waste and 2,000 tons of recyclable products every day.
I wanted to know them as individuals.
I wanted to understand who does that work.
What does the uniform feel like to use the uniform and take that charge?
So I started a research project with them.
I traveled in the trucks and walked through his trajectories and interviewed people in office and facilities across the city, and I learned a lot, but it was still an intuition.
I needed to go further.
So I started working as a garbage collection.
Now I didn't just travel in the trucks. I drive.
And I operated the mechanical scans and the snow barrier.
It was a remarkable privilege and an amazing learning.
Everybody asks about smell.
It's there, but it's not as much as you believe, and in the days that it's very strong one is used quickly.
It costs a lot to use the weight.
I met people who had worked on it for several years and their bodies kept putting into the weight of taking on their body tons every week.
There's also the danger.
According to the Bureau of Labor statistics, the recycling of waste is one of the most dangerous organisms in the country, and I learned the reason.
You're coming out and getting into the traffic all day and they pass around you.
They just want to happen, so in general, the driver is not paying attention.
That's really bad for the worker.
And also the garbage itself is full of dangers that often fall from the truck and cause terrible damage.
I also learned about the implications of garbage.
When you come out of the culture and you see a city from the back of the truck, you get to understand that garbage is like a force of nature itself.
It never stopped coming.
It's also as a form of breath or circulation.
It should always be in motion.
And it's also the stigma.
And it seems to me that stigma is especially ironic because I strongly believe that waste recognition is the most important work in the streets in the city, for three reasons.
It's the first public health proteins.
If you don't get rid of the waste in efficient and effective way every day, this starts getting rid of your container and your inherent dangers are threatened in very real ways.
Designers that we had controlled for decades, and centuries come back and start to give us.
The economy needs them.
If we can't get rid of the old, we don't have space for what the motors of economics start to fail when they are in danger of consumption.
I'm not advocating by capitalism, only to be your relationship.
And then there's what I call our average average speed rate.
I mean simply at the speed that we used to move in the contemporary time.
We usually don't worry about it, and we don't think, cleaned or lead with us our coffee cup -- our balls bag, our water bottle.
We use them, we took them, we forgot about them, because we know there's a work force on the other side that will get rid of it.
So today I want to suggest to you today a couple of ways of thinking about waste collection that might help reduce the stigma and include them in that conversation about how to design a sustainable and human city.
His work, I think, is almost limited.
They're in the street every day, in a rhythmic way.
They use a uniform in many cities.
You know when to wait for them.
And their work allows us to do our own.
They're almost a form of relief.
The flow that keeps us except leaves ourselves, of our own waste, our resources, and that flow should always stay in one way or another.
One day after September 11, 2001, I heard the group of a waste collection truck on the street, grab my little son and I went down the stairs running up, and there was a man doing his paper recycled of paper as all the miraculars did.
And I tried to thank you to do his work that particular day, but I started crying.
And he looked at me and just sticks, and he said, "We're going to be fine.
We're going to be good."
Shortly after that I began to investigate the waste collection and I went back to that man.
It's called Paulo, we worked together and we made good friends.
I want to believe that Paul was right.
We're going to be fine.
But in our efforts to rethink the way we exist on this planet as a species we need to include and get into account every cost -- even the very real human cost of the labor hand.
The municipal waste, what we think when we talk about garbage -- they represent three percent of the amount of waste of nation.
It's a remarkable statistics.
So in the flow of his days and their lives, the next one that you see to someone whose work is to clean up the trash of you, to take a moment to recognize them.
Take a moment to tell you thank you.
My work focuses on the connection of thinking in our community life by forming part of the environment where architecture was born naturally from conditions and local traditions.
Today I brought two recent projects as a example of this.
Both projects are located in emerging countries, one in Ethiopia and the other in Tunisia.
They also share the fact that the different analytics from different perspectives become an essential part of the ultimate architecture.
The first example started with an invitation to design a commercial center of several floors in the capital of Ethiopia, Addis Abed.
This is the kind of building that showed us as a example, to my team and me, about what we had to design.
At first, the first thing I thought was, "I want to go out correcting."
After seeing some of these buildings there are many in the city, we realized that there are three important aspects to relax.
In principle, these buildings are almost empty because they have very large stores where people can't afford to buy things.
Second, you need to employ a lot of energy because the revenue with crystals generates heat inside the interior, so it takes a lot of face.
In a city where this shouldn't happen because it's a temperate climate that goes from 20 to 25 degrees across the year.
And thirdly, your aspect has nothing to do with Africa or with Ethiopia.
It's a shame trying to be so rich in culture and traditions.
In our first visit to Ethiopia, I was really carved with the ancient market who is this structure to the free air where thousands of people, and they buy things every day at small sellers.
There's also that idea of using public space to generate external activity.
So I thought, that was what really wanted to design, not a commercial center.
But the question was how to build a modern building, of several floors, applying these principles.
The next challenge was introduced by the site, which is located in an area of a lot of growth in the city, where a lot of the buildings we now see in the image, didn't exist.
And it's also between two parallel streets that don't communicate in an extension of hundreds of meters.
So the first thing we did was create a connection between these two streets, using all the entries in the building.
And this is spread with an inclined atheist that creates a space to the free air in the building that is protected by its own form, the sun and the rain.
And around this space, we've applied the idea of the market with small businesses, which changes on every floor because of the form of space.
I also thought, how do you close the building?
I wanted to find a solution that responds to local climate conditions.
And I started thinking about a similar tissue to a card of concrete with drilling to allow the input of the air, and also the light, but in a filter way.
Then we were inspired in these beautiful buttons.
They have fractal geometry, and it helped me model the facade to model.
We're building that with these little pieces of predators that are the windows that let the air and light in a way controlled inside the building.
This is completely completed with these little colors of colors that use light inside the building to illuminate the building at night.
With these ideas it didn't happen easy to convince developers because they thought, "That's not a commercial center, it wasn't what we asked.
But ultimately, we all realized that this idea of the market turned out to be much more profitable than the commercial center because ultimately there were more local to sell.
And also the idea of the facade was much more economic, not only because of the material compared to the glass, but also because it wasn't necessary to have an air conditioning anymore.
So we got certain savings in the budget that we use to implement the project.
The first thing was to think about how to achieve energy enforcement for the building in a city where electricity cuts almost every day.
So we got a big advantage putting pictures on the roof.
And then under those panels we think of the roof as a new public space with meeting areas and bars that would create this urban oasis.
And these bumps on the roof, that on the contract collect water for the health of the inside.
It's expected for the next year, because we go through the fifth floor of construction.
The second example is a master plan of 2,000 apartments and services in the city of Tunisia.
And to make a project that big, the biggest one I ever designed -- needed not only to understand the city of Tunisia but also its environment, its tradition and culture.
During that analysis I put special attention in the middle, a 1,000 year-old structure that was surrounded by a wall with dozens of access connected by almost straight lines.
When I went to the place, the first design operation we did was extend existing streets, creating 12 similar blocks similar in size and features that there are in Barcelona and other cities in Europe with these patients.
In addition to that, we select some strategic points in relation to the idea of the down doors with straight lines, and this made the initial model.
And the last operation was to think about the cell, the little cell of the project as an apartment, as an essential part of the master plan.
I thought, what would be the best orientation for an apartment in the media climate?
And it's North, because it creates a thermal difference between both sides of the house and therefore a natural ventilation.
So we learned a scheme that claims that most apartments are perfectly oriented in that direction.
And this is the result that is almost like a combination of the European block and the Arab city.
It has these blocks with patients, and then on the low plant, we have all the connections to the pedestrians for the pedestrians.
And it also responds to local norms that make greater density on higher levels and a lower density on the low plant.
And it also reinforces this idea of the doors.
The roof, which is my favorite space of the project is almost like reducing the community the space occupied by construction.
It's where all neighbors, they can go up and sociological, and make activities like running a two miles in the morning, or jumping from one building to another.
These two examples, they have a common approach in the design process.
And also, they're in emerging countries, where you can see cities literally growing.
In these cities, the impact of architecture in people's lives changes communities and local economies at the same rate that buildings.
For this reason, I see even more important to look at architecture looking for simple but affordable solutions, which improve the relationship between the community and the environment, and they have as a goal to connect nature with people.
Thank you very much.
When I was eight years old, a new girl came into our class. It was as remarkable, as you see all the new girls.
He had huge amounts of hair very bright and a little little line of pencils cute -- it was very strong for the capital of states, very good at organic.
I ended that year, and I was full of classrooms, until I brought my own plan.
One day I had a time after the school came out of school. It was a little bit late, and I hid on the girls' bathroom.
When the cost was still still, I went out, I went into the classroom, I took off the table of my master's table.
And then I did.
I altered the ratings of my rivals, just a little bit, just some of them.
All the time.  And I started to return the book into the candy, but to see, some of my other partners had very good news as well.
So in a sentence, I ran the notes around the world, without any imagination.
I put all of them from Dolly and myself a row of that, just to be there, because I could.
I still surprise me what I did.
I don't understand how the idea came out.
I don't understand why I felt well doing it.
I felt important.
I don't understand why they never caught me.
That is that everything was completely obvious.
They never found me.
But most of all, I get rid of the reason why I was bothered that this little girl, so small, was so good for automatic.
I was intrigued by the jealousy.
They're so mysterious and so plant.
We know that babies suffer from jealousy.
Also the primates, the blue birds are very property.
We know that the cells are the number one cause of school killings in the United States.
And yet I've never seen a study that analyzes loneliness or long duration or sadness.
And so, you have to go to fiction, because novels are like the lab in which the cells are studying in all of their possible forms.
In fact, I don't know if it's an exaggeration to say that if there was no classrooms, I would have no literature.
Well there would be no Helve in it, no Opera.
There would be no reason or "The Thousands and a nights.
There would be no Shakespeare.
It would be the list of high school reading lists, because we would be losing "The North and the Furdflow," there would be no "Gatemaker, or "Party: We would lose from "Man Boston and "And K.C."
Without jealousy, there is no Prosport. I know it's fashionable to say that Proust has the answers to everything, and in terms of the jealousy.
This year, 100 years ago of their masterpieces taken, "In search for lost time, the most exhaustive study of sexual cells and also the ordinary competition, my own, everything we could have.  And thinking about Prosthetic, we have the mental details, right?
We think of a child trying to reconcile sleep.
We think of a magnetic magnifier in a landscape of landing.
We forget how hard that image is.
We forgot how implanted it is.
I mean, this is books that Virginia Wolp said were as hard as cat tribe.
I don't know what cat trick is, but we assume it's surface.
Let's see why they go so well together, the novel and the cleaners, the jealousy, and Prosthetic.
Is it going to be very obvious like rules, who reduced to the person, to their wish, to their pressures, are a very solid narrative?
I don't know. I think we get very close to the bone, when we think about what happens when we feel classrooms.
When we feel classrooms, we tell ourselves a story.
A story about other people's lives, and those stories make us feel terrible because they're designed for that, to make us feel bad.
Being at the same time narratives and audience, we know exactly what details will include to charge the knife, right?
The classrooms make us all amateur novelty, and that's something that Proust understood.
Everything that she does to give me pleasure could give another pleasure to another, maybe right now."
And it starts to tell himself that story, and since then, Proust says that every fresh love that Swantashima detects in his lover, he adds it to his collection of torture instruments in his private camera.
You have to admit that Shadi and Prosthetic, they were remarkably clever.
You know, the Project notes would have to leave the country, if they wanted to break with it.
But you don't have to be so clever to recognize that it's hard work. Right?
The soldiers are stores.
It's a hungry emotion. You have to feed it.
And what are the classrooms?
The soldiers are nurturing the information.
The cells use the details.
The cells like the big amounts of bright hair and the cute and small line of legs.
The classrooms are nurturing the photos.
That's why Instagram is so successful --  I was producing the language of accidental language with the classrooms.
When Shadi is in his leave arrow, suddenly he heard behind the doors and bribe to the servers of his lover -- then they define those behaviors.
He says, "Look, I know you think this is remarkably, but it's not different than the interpretation of an ancient text or to look at a monument."
He says, "It's scientific research with true intellectual value.
Proust is trying to prove that the soldiers look into intuitive and make us seem absurd, but in their phone, they're search for knowledge, the truth of truth, a painful truth. In fact, to what I produced to Product consideration, the more painful the truth better.
The pain, the humiliation -- the loss, the loss -- these were the pathways to Prosthetic wisdom.
He says, "A woman who we need, that makes us suffer in us a range of much more profound and vital feelings than a wise man who can be interested?
Is it telling us that we're going to look for women crisis?
No. I think it's trying to say that the cells reveal ourselves.
And there is some other emotion that makes us open up this particular way?
Is there any other emotion reveals us our aggression, our horrible ambition and our rights?
Any other emotion that teaches us how to look at intense intensity?
Freud would write about this later.
One day, Freud was visited by a very small young man who was consumed with the idea that his wife was fooled.
And Freud says there was something strange in that man, who didn't look at what his wife did.
Because she was innocent -- everybody knew it.
The poor creature was under suspicion without any cause.
But he looked for things that he did his wife without realizing involuntary behaviors.
Do you smile too much? Or do you accidentally stand with a man?
Freud says the man was becoming the curve of his wife.
The novels are very good at this.
The novels describe very well how the soldiers make us look at intensity but without precision.
In fact, the more intensely we are, the more we become residents of the fantasy.
And for this reason, I think, the cells lead us to make violent acts or illegal act.
Cleans drive us in completely unimaginable ways.
Now I'm thinking about me at eight years old, I recognize it, but I'm also thinking about this story I heard in the news.
A woman in the age of 52 years was captured by having created a fake account on Facebook from the one that was sent up with visitors, horrible to itself, for a year.
For one year. All a year.
She was trying to insult the new girlfriend of his former boyfriend -- I have to confess that when or this, they reacted with admiration in it.
Because, let's be realistic.
How big -- although unfortunately, creativity. Right?
It's like novel.
Like a novel of Patien High Panda.
High is one of my favorites.
She's a very strange and brilliant character of American literature.
It's the author of "The "The "The "The "The "The "The "The "The "The "The "The "The "The "The "The "The "The "The "The "The Strangers and The Talent Mr. Ridge: The books that deal with how the jealousy, confuse our minds, and once we are in the sphere, in the realm of the jealousy. The membrane that separates what it is that might be, can be punched in a
Let's take Tom Rio, his most famous character.
Tom Ridge is going to love or want what you are going to have to get out of your self and put yourself out of what you ever had, and it's under the floor. He responds to your name, it takes your rings, it takes your bank accounts.
It's a way.
But what do we do? We can't take Tom Riownize.
I can't give you all the world, as much as I would like sometimes.
It's a pity, because we live in times of envy.
We live in times of jealousy.
That is, we are good citizens of social networks, where the coin is envy. Right?
The novels show us? I'm not sure.
So we're going to do what characters always do when they're not secure, when they're in a mystery.
Let's go to the 224 of Baker Street and ask him by Shandla Holland.
When people think of Dutch, think about the curse in the Martin Martin Professor that criminal genius.
But I always prefer "The Institute Lest, the head face of Scott Adam that needs Hollywood desperately to be the genius of Hollywood, but it bothers him.
Oh, it sounds so familiar.
Lester needs its help, but it resists it, and bubble in the fall of the mystery.
But as they work together, something starts to change, and finally in "The And Six Nations Andyting, once Hollywood comes in, he used all of the students with his solution, Lester comes back to Hollywood and says, "We're not jealous -- Mr. Hollywood.
We are proud of you."
And he tells him that there is no person in Scott Andrew who didn't want to shake your hand.
It's one of the times that we see Homo translated in history. I find this very emotional. That scene is also mysterious, right?
It seems to treat the cells as a geometry, no emotion.
You know, in a Moore's month is the opposite side of Lester.
The next minute they are on the same side.
Suddenly Lester is allowed to admire that idea of being him the result.
Could it still be so simple.
What if the classrooms are actually a question of geometry, just a question where we allow us to be in relation with the other?
Well, maybe we don't have to be aware of the excellence of the other.
We can align with it.
But I like the continue plans.
So as long as we expect that to happen, we remember we have the fiction.
Only fiction.
The fiction used to be the documents, invite them to the table.
And look at what I agreed," the Laden Lead, the Trek Tom Ridge, the crazy Swantase, the same Mars Production.
We're in excellent company.
Thank you.
We used to solve big problems.
On July 21, 1969, Buzz Aldrin jumped outside of Apollo 11 and disappeared on the California Sea.
Armstrong and Aldrin were alone, but their presence in the surface surface was the culmination of a compelling collective process.
The Apollo program was the largest movement in peace times in the history of America.
To get to the moon, NASA spent about 180 billion dollars today, or four percent of the federal budget.
The Apollo gave a few 400,000 people and asked the collaboration of 20,000 companies, universities and government agencies.
They died people, including the Apollo 1.
But before the Apollo program, 24 men traveled to the moon.
Doctor walked on their surface, from which Alberto after the March of Armstrong last year, is now the oldest one.
So, why did they go?
They didn't bring a lot of it back, 383 pounds of old rocks, and something that 24 will deliver later, a new sense of small and fragility of our common home.
Why were they? The cynical answer is that President Kennedy wanted to demonstrate the Soviets that this nation had better rockets.
But the words of Kennedy at Rice University in 1962, they give us a better idea.
John F. Kennedy -- some ask, why is it?
Why do we turn it into our goals?
And you could also ask, why scale the highest mountain the mountain?
So 35 years ago, why fly about Atlantic?
Why play Rice against Texas.
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon.
We choose to go to the moon in this decade, and do other things, not because they're simple, but because they're hard.
Jason Pong: For the contexts, the Apollo was not just a victory of the West on the East War.
At the time, the strongest emotion was to marvel to the transition of the power of technology.
They were because it was great to be able to do it.
The landing on the moon happened in a context of a long list of technological triangles.
The first half of the 20th century produced the assembly line and plane, penicillin and vaccine for tuberculosis.
In the middle of the century, policing and smallpox.
Technology seemed to have what Alvin Jonation in 1970 called "collection force."
For most of the history of humanity, we couldn't go faster than a horse or a candle with candle -- but in 1969, the Apollo 10, the train of Apollo 10 miles an hour.
Since 1970, no human being has come back to the moon.
No one has traveled faster than the Apple 10, and the optimistic joy of technology has been evolved by seeing that problems that we imagine that technology will solve how to go to Mars, create clean energy, cure cancer, or feed the world population seem to be intractable outcome.
I remember watching the Apollo 17.
I was five years old, and my mother told me they didn't look at the escape.
I knew that this would be the last mission of it, but I was completely sure that I would come to see the colonies on Mars.
So that of something happened to our ability to solve problems with technology has become a common place.
We hear it all the time.
We've heard it for the last two days here, at TED.
It looks like the technologies would have been distracted and had been enriched with trivial toys, things like iPhone, apps and social networks, or algorithms that speed up the automated sale.
There's nothing wrong in most of these things.
They have expanded and enriched our lives.
But they don't solve the big problems of humanity.
What happened?
There is a paralyzed explanation in Silicon Valley, who trust that they have created less ambitious companies than the years that were funded Intel and Microsoft, Apple and Gene.
Silicon Valley says that markets are the cultures, in particular, the incentives that venture capitalists offer the entrepreneurs.
Silicon Valley says that the risk of risk caused that the creation of transformative ideas is changed by the funding of incremental problems or even false problems.
But I don't think this explanation is good enough.
It explains mostly what goes wrong in Silicon Valley.
Even when the risk capitalists were at their light point without worrying about the risk, they preferred small investment, tiny investments that they could come out in 10 years.
The CARPRE have always had problems to invest with benefit in technologies as energy, which need a huge capital and whose development is long-term -- they haven't invested in the development of technologies that are meant to solve big problems because they don't have an immediate commercial value.
No, the reasons why we can't solve big problems are more complicated and profound.
Sometimes we choose not to solve the big problems.
We could go to Mars if we wanted to.
NASA has even designed a plan.
But going to Mars would require a political decision that was popular and that will never happen.
We won't go to Mars because everybody thinks there are more important things to do on Earth.
Sometimes, we can't solve big problems because political systems fail.
Today, less than two percent of global energy consumption comes from renewable energy sources like solar and wind and biology. Less than two percent, and the reason is completely cheap.
Carbon and natural gas are cheaper than solar and wind, and oil is cheaper than the biomass.
We want some alternative energy sources that can compete in price, don't exist.
Now, technologists, entrepreneurs and economists are according to what policies and international treated would incentivize the development of an alternative energy, more importantly, a significant increase in research and energy development, and some kind of control of the coal price.
But there is no hope in the political climate today that we will see an energy policy of the U.S. or international treaties that reflect that consensus.
Sometimes, the big problems that seem technology, they are not going to be.
We know from the time that famine is a result of failure in the food report.
But 30 years of research has taught us that famines are political crisis that affect food distribution.
Technology can improve things like scores or systems for storage and food repair and food, but there will be famines while there were bad governments.
Finally, big problems sometimes choose a solution because we don't really understand the problem.
President Nixon will declare the war of cancer in 1974, but soon we discovered that there are many types of cancer, some terrible resistance to treatment, and only in the last 10 years they seem to have found effective and viable treatments.
The hard problems are hard.
It's not true that we couldn't solve the problems with technology.
We can and we can, but these four elements have to be presented: political leaders and population should want to solve the problem, and the institutions have to support the solution, and the institutions have to support the solution, it really has to be a technological problem, and we need to understand it.
The Apollo mission, which has become kind of like a metaphor for the ability of technology to solve big problems, and it turns out those creatures.
But it's a relative model in the future.
We're not in 1961.
There is no galaxy competition like in the Cold War, there is no policy like John Kennedy who inherit the difficult thing and dangerous, and there is no popular mixture of science fiction like exploring the solar system.
In general, going to the moon turned out to be simple.
I was just three days.
And really, I wasn't even making any problem.
We're alone in our present, and the solutions of the future will be harder to get.
God knows that we don't miss the challenges.
Thank you very much.
Well, I'm going to talk about trust, and I'm going to start by remembering the ideas that have been about trust.
They're so common that they've become clip of our society.
I think it's three.
The first one is a recycle: there's been a great decrease of trust, it's a very generalized belief.
The second is an objective -- we should have more trust.
And the third is a task, we should recover trust.
I think the religion, the goal and the task have gone wrong.
What I'm going to try to tell you today is a different story about a recommend, an objective and a task that I think gives a clear idea about the subject.
So first of all, reconcile, why do people think trust has done?
And if I think about the basis of my own evidence, I don't know the answer.
I urge to think that it may have gone down into some activities or institutions and that could have augmented in others.
I don't have it clear.
But I can turn to the opinion polls and opinion polls are supposedly the source of the belief that trust has decreased.
When you look at the opinion polls over time, there are no evidence of it.
That is, the people who were described 20 years ago, mostly journalists and politicians, continue to inspire the same respect.
And the people who were very reliable about 20 years ago, they continue to be pretty relatively, judges -- nurses.
The rest of us are in the middle, and by the way, the average citizen of the street is almost exactly half the way.
But is this evidence enough?
What opinion polls are, of course, opinions.
What else can you record?
What you look at is the generic attitudes that people manifest when they ask certain questions.
Do you trust the politicians -- trust the teachers?
Now, if someone would ask you, "Are you "about the vertical?
Do you trust fisheries?
Do you trust the teacher's teachers.
You probably start to ask, "To do what?
And that would be a very sensible response.
And you might say, when you've answered your question, "Well, I trust some of you, but in other not."
It's very rational.
Ultimately, in real life, we tend to separate trust differently.
We don't assume that the level of trust that we're going to feel for a certain kind of office, work or type of person, is going to be uniform in all cases.
So I could say, for example, I trust a certain primary teacher I know to give the class of reading, but no way to drive the school microbes.
After all, I could know that it wasn't a good driver.
I could trust my oldest friend to keep a conversation, but no, maybe to keep a secret.
Simple.
And if we've gotten those evidence in our everyday lives in the way that trust is different, why do we leave all that knowledge when we think about trust in more abstract confidence?
I think the polls are really bad tools to measure the real level of real trust, because they try to learn the good judgment in the fact of trusting something or somebody.
Secondly, what about the goal?
The goal is to have more trust.
Frankly, I think it's a stupid goal.
It's not the goal I would get.
I would aim to have more trust in what it's about trust, but not what it is.
Ultimately, I'm a paradigm of not trust what is not reliable.
And I think that those people who set their savings with the very closely named Mr. Madden, who then disappeared with them, I think about them, and I think, well, yeah, they were too confident.
Having more confidence is not a smart goal in this life.
So trust depression or denied with intelligence, that's the right goal.
Once you tell it, he says, yeah, yeah, that means that what matters in the first place is not trust, but trustworthiness.
What it's about to make a judgment about how trustworthy people are in certain ways.
And I think that we can do a trial, we're forced to focus on three things.
Are they competents? Are they honest? Are they responsible?
And if we find that one person is competitive in the personal materials, and it's responsible and honest, then we will have a very good reason to trust it, because it's going to be worthy of trust.
But if, in the contrary, they're not responsible -- we couldn't trust them.
I have friends who are complex and honest, but he didn't trust them to take a letter to the mail because they're flowing.
I have friends who are very sure that they can do certain things, but I see that they overestimate their own competitions.
And I'm very happy to say that I think I don't have many friends who are competent and responsible but extremely decorative.
If it's like that, I still haven't been perceived yet.
But that's what we're looking for."
Trust is the answer.
The trustworthiness.
And of course, it's hard.
In the last decades, we've tried to build accountability systems for all kinds of institutions, professionals, functioning and so forth, that made us easier to judge their trustworthiness.
Many of those systems have had the opposite effect.
They don't work as they should.
I remember once I was talking to a party and he said, "Well, you see, the problem is that it takes more time to make the administrative paper than will take the piece of part."
And we found the same problem in all of our public life, and institutional life, that the accountability system that is destined to ensure conflict and the conflict testing, actually is doing the opposite.
What they do is to figure out the work of people who have to do hard tasks, like the parts, by making them the cards" as we say.
I sure you all know similar examples.
All of that, for the goal.
I think the goal should be more conflict, and that things would be different if we try to be worthy of trust, and we will convey the people that we are trustworthy and if we try to determine whether other people, work or politicians are definitions of trust.
It's not easy. It's the trial, the simple actions, the attitudes -- what is not done.
Third, the task.
It's going to call the task to rebuild trust, put things upside down.
It suggests that you and I should rebuild the trust.
Well, we can do it with ourselves.
We can reconstruct a little bit.
We can do it if you are two people, together, trying to improve trust.
But trust, in definition, is different because we have other people.
You can't reconstruct what other people have given you.
You have to give them enough bases so they can trust you.
You have to be worthy of trust.
And that, of course, is because you can't deceive it, usually all people, all the time.
But you also have to take evidence that you're worthy of trust.
How do you do that?
That is done every day, everywhere, the common people, the officials -- the institutions very effectively.
I'll give you a simple commercial example.
The store where I buy my socks says I can bring them back without explanation.
I take you and get my money, or I change them by the color that I want.
That's great. I trust them because they themselves become vulnerable to me.
I think there's a big lesson in that.
If you become vulnerable to the other part, that's a very good proof that you're worthy of trust and you have trust to what you're saying.
So at the end, I think what we're pointing forward is not really hard to tell.
What people trust is in relationships, and in that framework, they can determine when and how the other person is worthy of trust.
Thank you.
From the beginning of computers we have been working for reducing the separation between us and digital information, the separation between our material world and the world of the screen where imagination can be devoted.
This separation has been reduced by getting smaller, increasingly and more, to such a point that today is less than one millimeter, the thickness of the glass of a tactile screen, and the power of computing has become accessible to everyone.
But I ask myself, and if there were no barrier?
I started to imagine what it would be.
First of all, I created this tool that goes into digital space, so that when the strong operations against the screen are transferred to its physical body to pieces.
Designers can map their ideas directly in 3D, and surgeons can practice with virtual organs underneath the screen.
So with this tool you break down the barriers.
But the two hands remain still outside the screen.
How do you get inside and interact with digital information using the entire dexterity of the hands?
In the Apple Apard Science division of Microsoft, along with my mentor Canada Boll, I took the computer and transformed a little space on the keyboard in a digital area of work.
By combining a transparent view with deep cameras to detect the fingers and the face, you can now lift the hands of the keyboard, get into the inside of the 3D space, and grab pieces directly with your hands.
As windows and files have a location in real space, select it is as easy as to grab a book of a stage.
You can choose the book and pick lines or words with the virtual tactile sensor underneath every floating screen.
Architects can stretch or rotate their models directly with their hands.
In these examples, we entered the digital world.
What if we invest the papers and make digital information come to us?
And surely, many of us will have bought and went through the Internet.
Now that doesn't have to worry about.
What I have here is a virtual test of the Internet.
This is the vision that you get from a device mounted in your head or translated when the system understands the geometry of your body.
If we take this idea further, I thought, instead of just seeing pixels in space, how can we make them physical so that we can touch them and feel it?
What would a future look like?
At the MIT Media Lab, with my tutor Hiroshi Israel and my collaborator Remember Poon, we created this only physical display.
This spherical magnet, it behaves as a 3D pixel in space, which means that both the computer as users can move the object anywhere within this little three-dimensional space.
So simulating, what we did was we announced gravity and control the movement through a combination of magnetic leadership, mechanical and detectors access.
And when we program digitally the object, we release it from time constraints and space, which means that human movements can record and go back and stay in the physical world.
You can teach chemicals physically and at the distance, and the famous shots of Michael Jordan, you can reproduce as a physical reality the time we want.
Students can use it as tool to understand complicated concepts like the movement of planets -- physics, and, unlike the monitor or text books, this is a real and palpable experience that you can touch and feel -- it's very powerful.
But what's more fascinating than changing the physical part of the computer is to imagine how the world program is going to change our everyday physical activities.
As you see, digital information will not only show us something but start acting directly about us as part of the physical world around us without that we have to recover from our world.
We started the talk today talking about a barrier, but if we suppress that barrier, the only limit that is our imagination.
Thank you.
I was trained to become a gym for two years in Hungari, China, in the 1970s.
When I was in the first grade, the government wanted to go to a school for athletes with all the Pakistani spending.
But my tiger mother said, "No."
My parents wanted me to become an engineer, like them.
After survived the Cultural Revolution, they firmly believed that there was only a brain path to happiness -- a safe and good job.
No matter whether the work would like or not.
But my dream was to be a Chinese opera.
This was me, in my imaginary piano.
A opera singer must start to train me from very young to learn the airports, so I tried everything I could to go to opera school.
And I wrote to the director of school and the president of a radio program.
But no adults love the idea.
No adult took me seriously.
Only my friends supported me, but they were kids, without authority, like me.
So at age 15 years old, I knew it was too much greater to train.
My dream would never be done.
I feared that during the rest of my life a second class happiness was the only thing that I could aspire it.
And this was so unfair.
So I resolved for another voice.
No one around me wanted to teach me? Okay.
I remember books.
(Music States Salmon Allies Elles Changera."
Those who were forbidden in China, of course.
"The Good Earth is about Chinese camera life.
And it's not predictable convinced.
The Bible is interesting, but strange.
That's a theme for another day.
But the fifth commandment for me was a reverse, "Have you heard your father and mother."
Heart: I said, "It's so different, and much better than obviously."
So it became my tool to come out of this conference track and to reset the relationship with my parents.
The encounter with a new culture also gave rise to my comparative reading.
It provides a lot of perspectives.
For example, at the beginning this map seemed to me outside of place because this is what the students in China learn.
I had never occurred to myself, China didn't have to be in the center of the world.
A map involves people's perspective.
Compassion reading is not new.
It's a common practice in the academic world.
There are all the way to research camps like comparative religion and comparative literature.
Compare and contract and offer academics a deeper understanding of a subject.
And I thought if the comparative reading worked to research, why not do it in everyday life?
So I started reading books.
You can treat people from Walker Frankline: John Adams of David McGowan who were involved in the same sound, or friends with shared experiences.
For the crisis, the temptation is economic, politics and spiritual.
For Buddha -- they're all psychological -- lust, fear and social duty -- interesting.
If you know another language, it's also fun to read your favorite books in two languages.
Charles Turk Tummer Thomas The Train The Table" path -- instead of losing me in translation. I found that you can win a lot of it.
For example, it's through the translation that I realized that happiness in Chinese literally means quickly "fat."
And "Bondina" in Chinese, literally means new mother." Oh.
The books opened up a magic door to connect with people from the past and the present.
I know it's not going to come back to feeling alone or powerless ever.
Having a distorted dream really is nothing compared to what many others have suffered with.
I've come to believe that the reality is not the only purpose of a dream.
Their most important purpose is to connect with the place of the dreams, where the passion comes from, where happiness comes from.
Until a destroyed dream can do that for you.
And it's because of books, which today I'm here, happy, living again with purpose and clarity, most of the time.
So books always get them.
Thank you.
Thank you.  Thank you.
When I was in my 20s, I saw my first psychological client to me.
I was a Ph.D. student in clinical psychology in Berkeley.
She was a 26 year-old woman named Alexander.
Alex came into the first session using cowboy and a hole cold, and he got on the couch of my office, and he took the shoes and told me I wanted to talk about his problems with men.
When I heard this, I was so relieved.
My class partner had a pyramid as a first client.
And I got a window that I wanted to talk about men.
I thought I could handle it.
But I didn't.
With the stories that Alex brought to the sessions, it made me easy to just move the head while we went back the solution.
"The tropics are the new neighbors: Alexander, and so I saw, she was right.
You start working later, you get home, you have children later, until death happens later.
For windows like Alex and I had time to go.
But soon after that, my survival was introduced me to press Alex to talk about her loving life.
I was scared.
I said, "Sure, he's coming out with guys under his category, you get up with a head head, but it's not like being married with him."
And then my surface said, "Not yet, but maybe it married the next time.
In addition, the best time to work in Alex marriage is before it comes care."
This is what psychologists call a "Based moment.
It was when I realized that the '30s are not the new 20.
Yes, people feel head after what they used to, but this didn't make the '70s were a pause in their development.
This made the '70s were the perfect moment, and we were wasting it.
So I realized that this kind of benign negotiation was a real problem and had real consequences, not only for Alex and his loving life, but for the careers, the families and the future of pollutants everywhere.
There are 50 million pounds in the United States, today.
This means 15 percent of the population, or 100 percent if they consider that nobody comes to adulthood without passing before by the 1970s.
Raise your hand if you're in your 20.
I want to see the windows here.
Oh, yeah! They're amazing.
If you work with pollutants, you love a pollen, you take the dream off a pollen, I want to see. It's good. Incredible. Very services matter.
This is not just my opinion. These are the facts.
We know that 80 percent of the key moments in life will happen at the age of 35 years.
This means that eight of every 10 decisions and experiences and "American moments, that they shape their life will have happened when they have 30 and so on.
People from over 40 -- they don't get into panic people.
This audience is going to be good, I think.
We know that the first 10 years of a race have an exponential impact about how much money they will win.
We know that more than half the Americans are married, they live or are coming out with their future partner at 30 years.
We know that the brain ends its second and final growth stage in their 20s, and it's reproductive for adults, which means that if there is something that you want to change themselves, now it's time to change it.
We know that personality changes more times during their 20th than at any time in life, and we know that female fertility comes to their laptop at 28 and things become complicated at 35 things.
The 20 is time to educate their body and their options.
When we think about the development of the child, we all know that the first five years are crucial for language and attachment in the brain.
It's a moment in which your daily and common life has an impact in the person who will become it.
But what we don't hear often is that there is something called adult development and our 20th are a critical moment in adult development.
But this is not what the pollutants are listening.
newspapers talk about changes at the time of adulthood.
The researchers call the 20th an extended adolescence.
The journalists take a ridiculous names to the windows like "Elley" and "cold."
It's true.
As a culture, we have considered a triangle that actually is the decade that defines adulthood.
Leonardo Bernean said that to make big things, you need a plan and not enough time.
Isn't it true?
What do you think happens when you hit a window in your head and say, "You have another 10 years to start your life?
Nothing happens.
They stole that person the sense of urgency and its ambition and doesn't happen absolutely anything.
And then every day, smart pollutants, interesting like you or your children and daughters come to my office and say something like this: I know my girlfriend is not good for me, but this relationship doesn't count for me, but this relationship is not. I'm just killing time."
Or they say, "Everybody says that as you start a career before the 30, everything will be good."
But then it starts to sound something like this: "My 20 are to finish and I still have nothing to show you.
I had better curve the day I graduated from college.
And then it starts to sound something like this: "My dates for the 20th were like the game game.
They all run and fun, but then at some point around 30, it turned out the music and everybody began to sit up.
I didn't want to be the only one I would stand on, so I sometimes think I married my husband because he was the nearest chair when I was 30.
Where are the windows here?
Don't do that.
Well, that sounds a little bit extreme. But you don't get wrong, risks are very high.
When you leave a lot of things for the 1930s, there's a huge pressure to the trains and so many of you start a career -- choose a city, choose a couple, and have two or three children in a much larger period of time.
A lot of these things are not compassionate, and there are research that start to show, which is much more difficult and stressful to do everything once at 30.
The media crisis is not about buying red sports cars.
It's about realizing you can't have the career you want now.
Let me tell you that you can't have the son you want now, or you can't give your son.
A lot of translations and cultures look at themselves, and to me, sitting in the room, and they talk about their 60s, "What was I doing? What was I thinking?"
I want to change what the pollen are doing and thinking.
Here's a story of how it could be.
It's a story about a woman called Emmanue.
At 25, Emma came to my office because he was, in his own words, having an identity crisis.
He said he would like to work in art or entertainment, but you still couldn't decide, so I spent the last few years working as a message.
As it was cheaper, I lived with a boyfriend who showed more temperature than ambition.
And despite living about 20 very difficult, their previous life had been even harder.
He cried up often in our sessions, but then she was lifted herself by saying, "One doesn't choose his family, but she can choose your friends."
Well, one day Emma got his head on his legs and cry for almost all the time.
I had just bought a new book for directors, and he had spent the whole morning reading it with his many contacts, but then he was looking at the empty space that follows after the words in the case of emergency -- please call the ...
I was at the point of the story when he saw me and said, "Who is going to be for me if I have a carbon accident.
Who is going to care if I give me cancer?
At that time, I got a lot of work to resist and not say, "I do."
What Emma needed was not a therapy that is really concerned about.
Emma needed a better life, and I knew this was his opportunity.
I had learned a lot since I worked with Alex as to just sit while the December decade of Emma went ahead.
So, over the next few weeks and months, I told Emma three things that all of the fingers, man or woman, deserves to know.
First of all, I told Emma to forget that identity crisis and get identity capital.
For identity capital, I mean doing something that makes a value to your person.
Doing something that is an investment in what you want to be next.
I didn't know the future of Emmanker career, and nobody knows the future of work, but I know this: identity capital generates capital.
So now it's time for that work to work on the other side of the country, from that interest, from that company that you want to test.
I'm not taking the very sensitive exploration, I'm taking away the exploration that I shouldn't count, that, by the way, is not exploration.
It's propaganda.
I told Emma to explore jobs and make them tell me.
Second, I told Emma that urban tribes are super-seeing.
The best friends are excellent to take the airport, but the windows that come together with friends with similar minds are limited to who you know, what they know about, how they talk about, and where they work.
That new capital piece of capital, that new person who will come out almost always comes from the outside of their closest circle.
The new things come from what they're called weak friends of friends from their friends.
Yeah, half of the pollen have a bad job or they don't have work.
But the other half no, and the weak links are the way to collapse this group.
Half of the works created never published, then knowing the boss of your neighbor is the way you get a job not published.
It's not cheating. It's the science of how information happens.
Finally, but not least, Emma believed that you don't choose your family, but I know your friends.
This was true when he was growing up, but as a vegetable, Emma will soon choose his family, when he has a partner and it forms his own family.
I told Emma that the time to choose his family had arrived.
Maybe you think that 30 is better age to feel like the 20 or even 25 and I agree with you.
But to choose the person that you live with now or tell you now when everyone on Facebook starts walking towards the altar.
The best time to work in your marriage is before you have it, and that means being as intentional in love as you're at work.
To choose your family must be a conscious choice of who and what they want instead of just making it work or kill time with whoever it is to pick them up to you.
So what happened to Emmanke?
Well, we looked at that principal, and she found the roommate of a cousin who worked on an art museum in another state.
This weak link helped him get a job there.
That job offered a reason to leave the boyfriend that I lived with.
Now, five years later, it's special organizations in museums.
This married with a man who chose a lot.
He loves his new career, love his new family, and I sent me a letter that said, "Now emergency costs are not big enough.
The story of Emma can sound easy, but that's what I love to work with windows.
It's very easy to help them.
The windows are like planes that come out of the airport of Los Angeles, who come out somewhere in the West.
Right before the slow, a slight fit in its trajectory makes the difference between landing in Alaska or in Farth.
In the same way, at 21 or 25 and even at the age of 29, a good conversation, a good description, a good TED talk can have huge effects in the next few years or even in the next generation.
Here is my idea of spreading all the pollen you know.
It's as simple as what I learned to tell Alex.
It's what I now have the privilege of saying to pollutants like Emma every day, and the transplant is not the new 20, they claim their adult, they get their devastation capital, they use your family links, they choose your family.
They don't let you define what they didn't know or what they didn't do.
They're deciding their life today.
Thank you.
When I was 27 years old, I left a very demanding job for a job that was even more excited: Doctor.
I went to teach them mathematics students in New York public schools.
And as any professor, I applied tests and tests.
You give them tasks.
When the work comes back, I calculated the grades.
What struck me was that the I.Q. wasn't the only difference between my best and my worst students.
Some of those who had a better performance didn't have a communication stage.
Some of my smartest kids were not going so well.
And that made me think.
The kind of things that you need to learn in mathematics in seventh grade, safe, are hard, proportions, decisions, the area of a player.
But these concepts are not impossible, and I was very convinced that each of my students could learn the lesson if they worked hard and during enough time.
After several years, I came to the conclusion that what we need in education is a better understanding of students and learning from a motivator perspective, from a psychological perspective.
In education, the only thing we know how to measure much better.
It's the C. but what if you're successful in school and life depends on a lot more than the ability to learn differently and easy?
So I left the classrooms and I went to university to become a psychologist.
I started studying children and adults in all kinds of challenging stage, and in every study, my question was, who has success here and why?
My research team and I went to the Microsoft West Post.
We tried to predict what chains remain in military training and who would be retractable.
We went to the National Department of Plate and tried to predict what kids would go as far as possible in competition.
We study night teachers working in really difficult neighborhoods, asking me what teachers are still teaching for the end of the school year and those who will be the most effective to improve the results of the learning of their students.
We partnered with private companies, asking yourself, which of these marketers are going to keep their job posture?
Who is going to make more money?
In all these very different contexts, it emerged a characteristic as an important prediction of success.
And it wasn't social intelligence.
It wasn't the good look, the physical health, and it wasn't the Italy.
It was determination.
Detrition is passion and perseverance.
The determination is to have resistance.
The determination is to take away their future, day after day, not only for the week, not only for the month, but for years and working really hard to make that future a reality.
The determination is to live life as if it was a marathon, not a career at all.
A few years ago, I started studying the determination in public schools in Chicago.
I asked thousands of students of high school to make my determination assumptions, and then wait about more than a year to see who they graduate for.
It turns out that children with more determination had significantly greater likely to graduate -- even when I matched them in every characteristic that I could measure, things like family income, the results of standardized testing, even the security that children felt when they were in school.
So it's not only in West Point or in the National Department of Delay in which it matters. It's also in school, especially for children at risk to abandon it.
For me, the most shocking thing about determination is how little we know, the little thing that knows science about its development.
Every day, parents and teachers ask me, "How do you develop determination in children?
What should I do to teach kids a solid job of work?
How do I keep them motivated for the long show?
The most honest answer is: I don't know.  And what I know is that talent doesn't give them apart.
Our data shows very clearly that there are many talented individuals that just don't go ahead with their commitment.
In fact, in our data, the determination is commonly not related or is even related to the measure of talent.
So far, the best idea I've heard about developing the determination in children is something called growth mindset.
This is an idea developed at Stanford University, and it's the belief that the ability to learn is not far, that it can change with the effort.
Dr. D has shown that when kids read and learn about the brain and how it changes and grows in response to challenge, they're much more likely to chase when they fail, because they don't think that failure is a permanent condition.
So growth mindset is a big idea to develop detail.
But we need more.
And that's where I will finish my speech, because that's where we are.
That's the work we have on the front.
We need to take our best ideas, our stronger intuitions and we need to test them.
We need to measure if they've been successful, and we need to be willing to fail, to wrong, to start everything again with the lessons learn.
In other words, we need to be determined about making our kids more determined.
Thank you.
Growing up in Taiwan like a calculator daughter, one of my most scary memories is my mother showing the beauty, the shape and the shape of Chinese characters.
Since that time, I was amazed by this incredible language.
But for an abroad, it seems to be as implicate as the Great Wall China.
In the last few years, I've been wondering if I can go down this wall, so that whatever I want to understand and appreciate the beauty of this sophisticated language can do it.
I started thinking about how a new, quick method of learning Chinese could be useful.
Since I was five years old, I started learning how to draw each of the traces of every character in the right sequence.
I learned new characters every day for the next 15 years.
Because we only have five minutes, it's better than doing it in a faster and simple way.
A Chinese academic would understand 20,000 characters.
You just need a thousand to understand basic literacy.
The first 200 will allow you to understand 40 percent of the basic literature, enough to read traffic signals, restaurants of restaurant, understand the basic idea of the websites or the newspapers.
I'm going to start with eight to show you how the method works.
Are you ready?
You open your mouth as much as possible until it's square.
They get a mouth.
This is a person who's going to give a ride.
People.
If the shape of fire is a person with arms on both sides, as if I was screaming in a fragile way, "Oh "Australia: I'm going to be shaking -- this symbol is actually original to the form of the call, but I like to believe that it's the other way. The one that works.
This is a tree.
tree.
This is a mountain.
The sun.
The moon.
The symbol of the door looks like a couple of doors of a mountain in the old West.
I call these eight characters.
They're building blocks to create a lot more characters.
One person.
If somebody walks back, that's to go."
As the ancient said, two are company, three are cultural.
If one person is going to be their arms, this person is saying "It was like big."
The person inside the mouth, the person is attacked.
It's a prisoner like Jones inside the whale.
A tree is a tree, two trees together, we have a forest.
Three trees together, we also have the forest.
They put a table under the tree, we have the cents.
Put a mouth on the tree, that's an infant."  Easy to remember, because a parallel tree is pretty idiot.
Remember the fire.
Two fires together, it becomes very hot.
Three fires together, that's a lot of flames.
Put the fire under the two trees, that's burned.
For us, the sun is the source of prosperity.
Two suns together, prosperity.
Three together, those are desert.
Put the sun and the moon shining together, that's the brilliant.
It also means tomorrow, after one day and a night.
The sun comes out on the horizon.
A door. Put a table inside the door, is the harbor of the door.
They put a mouth inside the door, ask questions.
Pocket, did there are somebody at home?
This person is coming out of a door, scaling, evaluative.
On the left, we have a woman.
Two women together, they're discussing them.
Three women together, having care is adult.
So we've already gone for almost 30 characters.
By using this method -- the first eight radical eight will allow you to build 32.
The next group of eight characters will build another 32.
So with every small effort, you'll be able to learn a couple hundred characters -- which is the same as an eight year-old Chinese.
So after knowing the characters, we started to create sentences.
For example, the mountain and fire together, we have a mountain of fire. It's a volcano volume.
We know Japan is the land.
This is a sun placed with the origin because Japan is in the east of China.
So a sun alongside the origin we created Japan.
A person behind Japan, what do we have?
A Japanese person.
The character on the left are two mountains piled one over the other.
In the ancient China, that meant in exile, because Chinese entrepreneurs were destroying their political enemies beyond the mountains.
Today, the exile has become out.
A mouth that tells you where to come out is a output.
This is a slide to remind me that I should stop talking and down. Thank you.
What I prefer to be dad is the movies I come to see.
I love to share my favorite films with my kids, when my daughter was four years old, we saw the ozone magician together.
The film dominated its imagination for months.
His favorite character was Gold, of course.
He gave him a good excuse to use a bright dress and take a magic wand away.
But when you see that film so many times, you get to understand that it's extraordinary.
We now live and we raised our children in a kind of industrial fantastic show.
However, Oz magician was an event itself.
It didn't start that trend.
The trend really took a couple of years later with, interestingly, another film whose proteins, a metal boy and a lost boy rescued a girl who was dressed as an enemy guard.
Do you know what I'm talking about?  Yeah.
There's a big difference between these two films, there are a couple of big differences between the Oslo magician and all the movies we see today.
One is that there's very little violence in the OECD magician.
The monkeys are pretty aggressive, like the breast.
But I think if the Oz magician is done today, the magician would say, Dorge, you're the Oscar of Oz as the teacher predicted it.
You use magic shoes to defeat the computer-generated army.
But that's not what happens.
Another unique thing about the Oz magician is that the most heroic characters, wise and even villages are women.
I started noticing this when I did Star Wars to my daughter, a few years later, and the situation was different.
At that time, I had a son.
It's three years.
It wasn't invited to the projection because it was still very small for that.
But it was the second son, and the level of superconduction had gone down.  And so he took away in the room and he was impressed as a mom hit with his legs behind it, and I don't think he would understand what happened, but inevitably, it absorbs everything.
I wonder what it does.
Would you be themes of value, persuasion and leadership?
Would you feel that Luke is an army to draw the government?
So we compare this to the October Mage of 1939.
How do I win the movie dog?
making good friends with all and being a leadership.
It's the kind of world that I want my kids to grow out, OK? And not a world of men who fight, which is where we are.
Why is there so much capital F force in the movies for our children, so little from the yellow board?
There's a lot of literature about the impact of male violence in girls, and they should read it. It's very good.
I haven't read so much about how kids react to this stable.
I know for experience that Leillie princess doesn't provide the right framework that I had served to navigate around the world of adults that's missing.  I think at the moment of the first kiss -- I really expected the credit to start to appear because it's the end of the movie, right?
My quest has finished, I have a girlfriend.
Why are they standing there?
I don't know what I should do.
The movies are focused on defeat the village and getting their reward, and they don't leave time for other relationships or other adventures.
It's almost like a child, you have to be a silly animal, and if you're a girl, you have to use a war suit.
There are many exceptions, and to defend Disney princess to any of you.
But they send a message to kids, even though they are boys, they are not really their target audience.
They do a phenomenal job by teaching girls how to defend the patient, but they don't necessarily show kids how to defend the pathogen.
There's no model for them.
We also have some great women who write new stories for our children, as real and lovely like Herois and Katherings, but they don't stop being movies of war.
Of course, the most successful issue of all time continues to appear in classic after classic -- each of them on the adventure of a child or a man, or two men who are friends, or a man and his son, or two men who were creating a girl.
Until many of you are thinking, this year, eventually came out Valley.
I recommend it to all of you. It's available in stores.
Remember what critical said when Valentine?
I can't believe that Pixar has made a film of a principle.
It's very good. Don't let it stop them."
Well, almost none of these films happens the Beatle test.
I don't know if you've heard about this.
It hasn't yet taken roots and already spread up, but maybe we will start a movement.
Allison Belgawain is a comic drug, and in the middle of the 1980s, I recorded a conversation that I had with a friend about the assessment of the movies that they saw.
And it's very simple. There's only three questions that you should do -- in the movie, there is more than a female character than have lines?
So, you have to fulfill the requirement.
These women talk to each other at some point in the movie.
Their conversations are about something more besides the kid than they like that?  Okay? Thank you.  Thank you very much.
Two women who exist and talk about things each other.
It happens. I've seen it, and yet very rarely I see it in the film we know and love.
In fact, this week I went to see a very good quality movie -- Archie.
Right? Rolled Oscarda, talent success, a sense of consensus of what a Hollywood movie film is.
Virtually not the Bearian test.
And I don't think it should, because a lot of the movie, I don't know if you've seen it, a lot of the film happens in an ambassador where men and women hide during the rewards of the residents.
We have a lot of scenes of men who have deep and painful conversations in this school, and it's the big moment for one of the actors to take a look at the door and say, come to bed, card?
This is Hollywood.
So let's look at numbers.
In 2011, from the 100 more popular films, how many of them think they have female protests?
Okay. It's not bad.
It's not the same percentage as the number of women that we've chosen recently for Congress, then it's fine.
But there's a larger number than this one that is going to decode this room.
Last year, The New York Times published a study that the government had done.
Here's what he said.
In the United States, one in five women says it's been sexually assaulted once in his life.
I don't think it's the blame of mass entertainment.
I don't think the movies for children have something to do with that.
I don't believe that music or pornography videos are closely linked to, but something is wrong, and when I hear that statistics, one of the things I think is that there is a lot of sexual aggressions.
Who are those guys learning? What are you learning.
What don't you do?
Are you associating the story that says that the role of a male hero is to defeat the village with violence, and then charge the reward, which is a woman who has no friends and not talk?
Are we doing that story?
You know, as a parent with the privilege of raising a daughter like those of you who are doing the same thing, we find this world and this very alarming statistics and we want to prepare them.
We have tools to our willingness as a power, and we hope that help, but I have to ask you, but I have to ask, hip-hop is going to protect you, at the same time, active or passionate, we're educating our children to keep their male power position?
I mean, I think Netflix list is a way to do something really important, and here I mean mainly to parents.
I think we have to show our children a new definition of shoulder.
The definition of malaria is radically changing.
You will have read about how the new economy is changing the role of the home and the alarmatic.
Everything is changing.
When I asked my daughter what his favorite character at "Star Wars knows what he was?
Web.
Obama Kenner and Gold.
So what are these two common?
Maybe it's not just the bright dress.
I think they're experts.
I think these are the two people in those movies that know more than anyone, and they love to share their knowledge with other people to help them achieve their potential.
They are leaders.
I like that kind of stories for my daughter, and I like that kind of stories for my son.
I want more stories like that.
I want less stories where my son is told to my son, and I find and fight just and more stories where your job is to join a team, maybe a team led by women, to help other people improve and be better people, like the Obama magician.
Thank you.
As a child, I lived in Maine, and one of the things I liked most was to look for sea cookies on the shores of Maine because my parents told me that I would give me luck.
But you know, it's hard to find these coast.
They're covered by sand and it's hard to see them.
However, over time, I used to look for it.
I started seeing shapes and patterns that helped me collect them.
This became a passion for finding things in a love for past and architecture.
And finally when I started studying Egypt, I realized that I will see with my own eyes wasn't enough.
Because, suddenly, in Egypt, my little beach in Maine had grown up to one of about 1,000 miles of length next to the Nike.
And my sea cookies had grown to the size of cities.
This is really what led me to use satellite images.
To try to make a map of the past, I knew it had to do otherwise.
I want to show you an example of how different we see the infrared infrastructure.
This is a place located in the eastern Delta of Egypt called Benjamin.
And the place, in simple sight, seems to be brown -- but when we use infrared and we process it using fake color, suddenly the place looks like bright rose.
What you're seeing is the actual chemical changes of the landscape caused by the materials of building and the activities of the ancient Egyptians and the ancient Egyptians of the agent.
I want to share with you how we used satellite data to find an ancient Egyptian city, called Italian, lost for thousands of years.
Italian was the capital of the ancient Egypt for over 400 years in a period of time called the Middle Empire about 4,000 years ago.
The place is located in El Fall, Egypt, and it's really important because in the Middle Empire -- there was this great renaissance of the ancient art art, architecture and religion.
The Egyptians have always known that Italian was located somewhere near the pyramids of the two kings that built them, they indicate inside the red circles here, but somewhere inside this huge rainforest plan.
This area is enormous. It's about six miles.
Before, the Nike flowing right next to Iceland and as he changed over time, he moved into this and covered the whole city.
So how do you find a separate city in an extended landscape?
Trying to find it at random would be the equivalent to look for a needle in a paradox, with the eyes sold and using baseball gloves in a paradox.
So we used NASA toxic data to make a map of the place, with very subtle changes.
We could see where the Nike was.
But you can see more detailed, and it's even more interesting, this slightly elevated area that you see inside the circle here, which we think might be the location of Iceland.
So we collaborated with Egyptians doing show jobs, you can see it here.
When I say show, it's like the show shots in ice, but instead of climate change, we look for the layers of human occupation.
Five meters down, underneath a thick layer of it, we found a dense layer of ceremonial objects.
This means that in this possible location of Iceland, five meters down, we have a layer of occupation of several hundred years of the Middle Empire, exactly the same period that we think is Iceland.
We also found the work of floor, collaborator, car and catastrophe, which shows that there was a jewelry workshop.
This might seem to be not much, but when we think about the most common stones used in the Morgan Empire, these are the stones that were used.
So we have a dense layer of occupation that data from the Middle Empire in this place.
We also have evidence of an elite jewelry workshop that shows that what has been there, was a very important city.
We still didn't find Italian here, but we'll go back to place in a near future to locate it.
And even more importantly, we have the resources to train young Egyptians in the use of satellite technology, so they can also make big discoveries.
I want to end with my favorite quote from the Middle Empire, probably written in Italian 4,000 years ago.
Showing knowledge is most of all vocabularies.
There's nothing like that on Earth.
So as it looks like, TED wasn't founded in 1984 Dr. C.
It really started in 1984 to C, C, in a lost city not for a long time and found from the high city.
It certainly puts the search of marine shells in perspective.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
I want to invite you to close your eyes.
Imagine outside the door of the house.
I want you to pay attention to the color of the door, to the material that it's done.
Now visualizing a group of obese noses in bicycle.
They're competing in a non-grade career and they're going to address their door door.
I need to look at this true.
They're paring strong, they're sweating, they go out a lot.
And they collide against the door of your house.
There are bicycles flying all over the place, wheels that go through their side, rays of the wheels that end up in absurd places. They pass the door threshold.
And the blood, the passenger, or what there is on the other side of the door, and look at the quality of light, shine light on the Gallon Monta.
He's holding them with your hand.
From his chair, on a brown horse.
It's a horse.
You can feel your blue ball by making them soldiers in the nose.
You can smell the sandwich cookie and you're about to get into the mouth.
Go on the side and train your living room.
In the room, and doing maximum use of his imagination, imagine British Spiders.
It's a little bit of clothes, dancing on its center message, singing "His Haiti Milo Moore Missile."
Now let me get to the kitchen.
The ground has been coated with yellow brick pathways, and from the oven, they come to you Dorothy, the Harvard Man -- the Piecounds and the Lego of "The Wizard of Oblet," carry out of hands, jumping to you.
Okay. Open your eyes.
I want to tell you about a peculiar contest that takes every spring in New York.
It's called the Memorial Campaign in the United States.
I went to cover this event a few years ago as a scientific journalist -- waiting for me, I suppose, that this was like the end of a wise operator.
There were several men and a few ladies of different ages and different hygiene.
They were meeting hundreds of random numbers, looking at them just once.
They memorized the names of tens and dozens of strangers.
They memorized entire poems in just minutes.
They compete to see who could memorize the order of a neighborhood bar.
And I thought, "This is incredible."
These people should be phenomenon of nature.
And I started talking to some of the competitors.
This is a man named Ed Cook who had come from England and has one of the best trained memories.
I said, "Hey, when did you realize that you were a known?
Ed said, "I'm not a wise guy.
Actually, I have an average memory.
Everybody who's involved from this competition said they have normal memory.
"We have trained ourselves to perform these miraculous memory acts using ancient techniques invented 2,500 years ago in Greece, the same techniques that they used Circle to memorize their speech, and that medieval academics used to memorize entire books.
And my reaction was, "Oh. How did I have no heard of this before?
We were standing outside the hall of competition, and Ed who is a wonderful and brilliant English, although a little bit excited, said to me, "John, you are an American journalist.
Do you know British Spiders?
And I said, "What? No, why?
Because I would like to teach British Speeds how to memorize the order in a live swimming deck on national television.
That would prove to the world that anyone can do it."
And I said, "Well, I'm not British Spiders, but maybe you can teach me.
I mean, you have to start by something right?
And that was the beginning of a very strange journey for me.
I ended up spending most of the next year not only training my memory, but also researching it, trying to understand how it works, why it doesn't work and what it can be their potential.
I met a lot of really interesting people.
This is a man called E.
He's amazing, very probably with the worst memory in the world.
His memory was so bad that I didn't even remember that I had a memory problem. It's amazing.
Somebody incredibly tragic -- but it was a window that allows us to see how much our memory makes us who we are.
At the other end of the spectrum, I met this man.
This is Kim Peer. And he was based on the paper of Dutch Housensians in the Ritus Manhattan."
We spent an afternoon together in the public library of Salt Lake City, by measuring phone books, was slide.
And when I came back, I read a number of treaties on the memory of the memory, something over 2,000 years ago in Latin, in Antarctica, and then in the Middle Ages.
And I learned a lot of really interesting things.
One of the most interesting things I learned is that there was a time when this idea of having trained memory, disciplined and grown wasn't a thing as rare as it can look like today.
A long time ago, people invest in their memory, to provide their minds.
These techniques have made our modern world, but they've also changed us.
They've changed us culturally and I would say that they've changed us as well.
As we already have no need to remember, sometimes we have forgotten how to do it.
One of the last places on our planet where you still find people passionate about this idea of a trained memory, disciplined and grown is this simple memory of memory.
It's not really as simplified, there are competition like this around the world.
I was fascinated. I wanted to know how these people do.
A few years ago, a group of researchers from London College invited a group of memory champions to the lab.
They wanted to know: Is it going to have brains in some way, structural or analytically different from the rest of us?
The answer was, no.
Are they more intelligent than the rest of the rest of it?
They gave them a cognitive test battery, and the answer was actually not.
There was yet a really interesting and significant difference between the memory champions and the control subjects that they were comparing them.
When they put them in a MRI machine, they took their brains as they were memorize numbers, faces and forms of cold cores -- found that in the memory champions they were lighting parts of the brain, different to others.
They actually used it, or they seemed to be used, a part of the brain that involves space and navigation.
Why? Is there something we can learn from this?
The cortist of competitive memory is driven as an armed career where every year comes up with a new way to remember more things, more quickly, and then the rest of the competitors should put the day.
This is my friend Ben Prize, three times a memory.
In his desk, in front of him, there are 36 developers of devastating swim that he's about to try to memorize in an hour, using a technique that he invented and that only he dominates.
He used a similar technique to memorize the precise order of 400 random binary digits.
Yes. Yes.
And as there is a lot of ways to remember things in these competitions, absolutely all the techniques used at the end of the end of a single concept that psychologists call lab consequence."
It illustrates with a paralyze paradox known as the Babylonian Parkinson's Parkin," Big says, "The following: I tell two people who remember the same word -- I tell you to you, remember there's a man called Backy."
That's his apple.
And then I ask you, remember that there's a bag?
And when I go back later, and I ask them, "Do you remember that word that I told you about a rest of a room?
You remember what it was?
The person who was told that his name is Babyl is unlikely to remember the same word as the person he said to her that his work is "gram."
Same word, different memory capacity, that's weird.
What happens here?
Well, the name Babbage, actually doesn't mean anything for you.
With all the other memories they dance for their head.
But the word, "God. We know parking.
They use smart white hats.
They have hard in your hands.
They smell good when they come home to work.
We probably know some park.
And when we first heard that word for the first time, we began to put association generators to fish them easily at some time.
One of the most elaborate techniques to do this data from 2,500 years ago in the ancient Greece.
It's known as the "memoral palm."
The story says this: There was a poet called Simoning that I attended to a bank.
They had hired it as entertainment, because before, if I wanted to give a very good party, it didn't take a DJ. It was hired to a poem.
He stood on foot, he got his memory poem, and he was shown, and so soon it was, the bank room was collapsed.
killing them all.
But not only killed them, but it destroys the bodies by letting them infant.
No one could say who was there, no one could remember where they were sitting there.
They couldn't be able to bury your bodies.
One tragedy behind the other.
Similarities, standing outside, only survivor, in the middle of the rubble -- closed your eyes and realized that with the eyes of his mind, I could see where I had been sitting in the invitation.
He took the families in my hand bringing them to where their loved ones were loved between the rubble.
What Simon added at that moment is something we all know about interestingly, and it is that no matter whether we're not good at remembering names, or phone numbers or instructions would work for the word of our colleagues, we have visual memory.
If I asked you to take the first 10 words of the story I just told you about Simonine, it's very likely to be very hard to do it.
But I would bet that if you ask them to say who was sitting on the front horse brown in his lobby, they would be able to visualize it.
The idea of memory palace is to create this building with your mind and put it out of images with the things that you want to remember -- the more crazy.
This is a advice that comes from over 2,000 years ago, to the first memory treaties -- in Latin, in Latin, in Latin, in Latin, in Latin, in Latin, in Latin, in Latin, in Latin, in Latin, in Latin, in Latin.
And how does it work?
So let's say you have been invited to the TED stage to give a talk and you want to make it memory in the same way you had done Circle if you had invited it to TEDTalks 2,000 years ago.
What you could do is imagine that they're on the door of your house.
And I will know some kind of absolutely ridiculous, crazy and unusual image to help you remember that the first thing you want to mention is that completely insight competition.
And then you can imagine coming into your house, and seeing the monster of the Gallon Poles mounted over Mister Ed.
And that would remind you that they want to introduce your friend Ed Cook.
And then you would see Britney Spiders to remind you that funny anecdote they want to count.
And then they would go into the kitchen, and the fourth issue that they would talk about would be that strange journey that they did for a whole year, and they have some friends to help them remember it.
This is how the Roman speakers would memorize their speech, not word for word, that will confuse them, but typical by typical.
In fact, the term "the Typical term comes from the Greek Guine," which means place."
It's a shame when people thought about the audience and the rhetoric with this kind of spatial terms.
The phrase in the first place, it would be like the first place in your memory galaxy.
I saw that this was just fascinating. And I was full of full of it.
I went to some of these memory competitions, and I had the idea of writing something strange about this substance of competitive memory.
But there was a problem.
The problem was that a memory competition is a publicly boring event.
And seriously, it's like seeing a lot of people sitting by taking tests -- I mean, the most exciting thing that happens is when someone is massage the front.
I'm a journalist, and I need to be able to write about something.
I know there are incredible things happening in the minds of these people, but I don't have access.
I realized that if I was going to tell this story, I needed to try to put myself in its place.
So I started spending 15 or 20 minutes every morning, before I sat up to see the New York Times, just trying to remember something.
Maybe a poem, or the names of an ancient school anxiety bought in a pulpost market.
And I found that this was surprisingly entertaining.
I'd never expected it to be.
It was fun, because it wasn't just about training memory.
What it actually is about doing is to improve more and more the ability to create and imagine these ridiculous images, comics, protection, insights, absolute and little eyes, in the eye of mind.
I was pretty excited about this.
This is me, using my standard training team for memory competition.
It's a couple of oranges and some security glasses covered with tape leaving only two holes, because the distribution is the worst enemy of a memory competition.
I ended up coming back to the same contest that I had covered a year earlier. I had the idea that I could come in, in a kind of participatory journalistic experiment.
I thought this could serve a good space for all of my research.
The problem was that the experiment came out of control.
And I won the competition -- something that I didn't have to happen.
Of course, it's nice to be able to memorize speech, and phone numbers, and shopping lists -- but actually this is not the point.
These are just tricks.
Because they're based on pretty basic principles about how the brain works.
And it's not necessary that you will build the palms of memory or memorize neighborhoods -- to benefit with a little bit of personality about how your mind works.
We often talk about people with a great memory as if it would be an innate gift, but it's not the case.
Great memories are education.
At the most basic level, we remember when we pay attention.
We remember when we concentrate deeply.
The memory palace -- these memory techniques, are just advance.
In fact, they're not even real shortcuts.
They work because they make us work.
They force a kind of deep processing process, a kind of complete attention that most of us don't have to run out there.
But the reality is, there's no stores.
That's how things get memorable.
And if there is something that I want to leave you today is what I want to leave with today, which I couldn't even remember that I had a memory problem, I left me, which is the notion that life is the sum of our memories.
How much are we willing to lose what our short existence is already missing in the Blacks or iPhone, not paying attention to being human in front of us, who walks around our side. Are we going to be so hostile that we don't even bother to process in deep?
I learned from the first hand that there are incredible memory capabilities in all of us.
But if you want to live a memorable life, you have to be the kind of person who remembers remember.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you today about the last 30 years of the history of architecture.
It's a lot to cover in 18 minutes.
It's a complex topic, so we're going to take a complex place, New Jersey.
Because 30 years ago, I'm from Nather's -- Jerry, I was six years old, and I lived there at my parents' home in a village called Liberia, and this was my child's bedroom.
On the corner, from my bedroom, I was the bathroom that I share with my sister.
And, between my bedroom and the bathroom -- there was a balance that gave the living room.
And there everybody was going to pass the room looking at the telly -- so every time I went from my room to bathroom, they all saw me, and every time I got it back and it comes back into a towel. They all see me.
And I was like this.
It was top, insecure and hated it.
I hated that journey, hated that balance, hated that room and that house.
That's the architecture.
Ready.
Those feelings that I feel, that is the power of architecture, because architecture is not about math, nor of areas of area, but of those visceral connections, emotional connections, that we feel in the places that we occupy in the places.
And it's not surprising that we sit in that way, because according to the Environmental Protection Agency -- Americans spend 90 percent of their time.
So 90 percent of the time are surrounded by architecture.
That's a lot.
Architecture determines us in ways we don't even realize it.
That makes us a little naive and very, very predictable.
So this means that when I show you a building like this, I know what I tell you, they think of power, system and democracy."
And I know that you think about it in a building in a building built 2,500 years ago by the Greeks.
This is a trick.
It's a descendant that uses architects to create an emotional connection with the ways we build our buildings.
It's a predictable emotional connection, we've used this trick for a long, long time.
We use it 200 years ago to build banks.
We use it in the 19th century to build art museums.
And in the 20th century in America, we use it to build houses.
See, these stable soldiers, solid soldiers, in front of the sea, away from the elements.
This is very, very useful, because building things is terrifying.
It's expensive, it takes a long time and it's very complicated.
The people who build them, the universities and the governments, are always afraid of innovation, and they prefer to use ways that know they're going to work.
So we found buildings like this.
It's a nice building.
It's the Public Library of Libera that ended up in 2004, in my hometown, and, you know, it has a dome -- it has this round thing, columns, red brick -- that let me see what Liberians are trying to communicate with this building, the kids, the property values -- history.
But it doesn't have a lot to do with a library today.
That same year, in 2004, on the other side of the country, it ended up another library, which looks like this.
It's in Seattle.
This library shows how we use media in the digital age.
It's a new kind of public equipment for the city, a place to meet and read and share.
So how is it possible in the same year, in the same country, two buildings, both called biomaters, are so completely different?
And the answer is that architecture works according to the beginning of the paradox.
On one side is innovation, architects who constantly drive new technologies, new types, new solutions for the forms of life today.
We drive, we launched and we launched so much, that we are completely away from people.
All of black, this depressed us. You think we feel very good, but we're dead inside, because we don't have another choice.
We have to go on the other side and come back with those appropriate symbols.
So we do that, and we're all happy, but we are all happy, but we feel like translators, so we started experimenting again, we make the slope swing back to forward, over and over again. So we've done it in the last 300 years, and of course, in the last 30 years.
Well, 30 years ago, we walked out of the '70s.
Architects were busy experimenting with the so-called "radiation."
It's got to do with concrete.
You can guess.
Small windows in a demonstration scale.
Something really hard.
So we approached the '80s, and we started to incorporate those symbols.
We pushed the slope back in the other direction.
We take those forms that we know that they like and we update them.
We add up and we added passes and we use new materials.
They love them.
We don't get down.
We take Charles and we convert them into skyscrapers that can be moved media made of glass.
The forms were free, they won in audacity and colonies.
The plants became columns.
The scenes grew up to the size of buildings.
A madness.
But it was the '80s, that was great.
We all spend the mouse in commercial centers, we moved to the neighborhoods, and there in the suburbs, we can create our own architectural fantasy.
Those fantasy, they could be in the Mediterranean or the French or the Italian.
You probably with a piece of bread sticks.
This is what happens with posters.
This is what happens with the symbols.
They're easy, they're cheap, because instead of creating new spaces, we get memories from other places.
I know very well, and you all know, this is not the Tasky.
This is Ohio.
Architects are frustrated and we started making the slope off again in the other direction.
In the early '80s, and in the early '90s, we started experimenting with the so-called decoration.
We took the historical symbols -- we now have new design techniques of design, and we find new composition -- some forms that are crashed against other forms.
This is academic and embarrassing, and it's super morality. You are totally excluded.
Normally the optimize slope again in opposite direction.
But then, something surprising.
In 1997, this building.
It's the Genome of Bible from Frank Gehry from Frank German.
This building changed fundamentally the relationship of the world with architecture.
Paul Follown said that Bilbao was one of those rare moments when critics and academics and public in general, they were completely according to a building.
The New York Times called this miracle of military.
The tourism in Bilbao increased by 2,000 percent when they finished the building.
So suddenly, everybody wanted one of those buildings, Los Angeles, Seattle, Chicago, New York, Cleveland, Spring.
Everybody wanted one, and Gehry was everywhere.
He was our first star architect.
But how is it possible that these forms, wild and radical forms, how is it possible that they become ubiquitous around the world?
And it happened, because media were gathered around them, and we quickly learned that those shapes meant culture and tourism.
We've created an emotional reaction with these forms.
The same thing made the major mayor of the world.
So everybody believed that if they had these forms, they had culture and turbutualists.
This phenomenon in the beginning of the new millennia, I went with other star architects.
He happened to Zaha and Liberia, and what happened with these few elite architects in the new millennium, actually started to go through all the architecture, digital media started to increase the speed of information consumption.
Think about how you consume architecture.
A thousand years ago, they would have to walk to the next village to see a building.
The transportation spends applied, they can take a boat, an airplane, they can be tourists.
The technology sped up, you can see in the newspapers, on the telly and at the end, we are all photographers of architecture, and the building is moving beyond its physical location.
Architecture is everywhere now -- that means that the speed of communications finally has reached the speed of architecture.
Because architecture moves so fast.
It doesn't do a lot of time to think about a building.
It takes a lot of time to build a building, three or four years, and at that time, an architect can design two, eight, or 100 more buildings, before you know if the one who designed four years ago was a success or not.
Because there has never been good feedback in architecture.
That's how we find buildings like this.
Brailing was not a two-year-old movement, but 20 years.
For 20 years, we were building buildings like this because we had no idea how much they wanted.
That's never going to happen again. I think, because we are in the largest revolution in the architecture from the invention of concrete. steel or acceleration, and it's the media revolution.
My theory is that when you apply the slope to media media, it starts to more and faster, until we are in both extremes almost simultaneously, and it really developed the difference between innovation and symbol, between us, the architects, and you -- the audience.
We can now make symbols almost instant with emotional charge of something completely new.
I'll teach you how the system works in a project that my company ended up recently.
We were hired to replace this building that was increasingly.
This is the center of a village called Pintanson's Pintangle Pintaches, in the state of New York.
It's a community of vacation.
But that meant that two years before the building was finished, it was already part of the community, and how drawings looked exactly the end of the day, there was no surprise.
The building came to be part of the community. That first summer, when people began to come and share it in social media, the building stopped being a building, became a media medium, because these are not just images of a building, they're the images that you made in the building.
And as you use it to tell your story, they become part of the personal narrative -- and that makes you correct with collective memory, and when we charge these symbols, we learn.
I mean, we don't need the Greeks to tell us how to think about architecture.
We can tell each other what we think about architecture, because digital media hasn't only changed the relationship between us, but they've changed the relationship between us and buildings.
Think about a second in those libraries of Liberia.
If that building was built today, we first go to the Internet in search for new "picking) "for new "pictures."
We would be bombarded with experiments, of innovation, about what a library can be.
That's mentors.
Money that can lead to the mayor of Liberia, to the people in London, and tell them that there is no unique response to what a library can be today.
Let's be part of this.
This abundance of solutions gives the freedom of experience.
Everything is different now.
Architects are no longer those mysterious creatures that use great words and complicated drawings, and you are no longer a decline that doesn't accept something that I haven't seen before.
Architects can listen, and you don't let it intervene for architecture.
That means that the thing of one style to another, from one movement to another, is irrelevant.
In fact, we can go ahead and find proper solutions to the problems facing society.
This is the end of the history of architecture, and it means that the buildings of tomorrow will be very different from buildings today.
This means that a public space in the ancient city of Seven can be unique and adapted to the measure of a modern city.
This means that a stadium in Brooklyn can be that, a stadium in Brooklyn, and not a bad historical mimicking of red brick with the idea of what a stadium should be.
This means that some robots will build our buildings, because eventually we will be ready for the ways that they're going to produce.
That means that buildings are amounting to the whims of nature and not the opposite.
This means that a parking garage in Miami Beach, Florida, can also serve to make sports or yoga.
This means that three architects can dream with swimming in the East River in New York City, and raising half a million dollars of the community together around that cause, it's no longer a client alone.
It means that no building is too small for innovation, like this little piece of feathers, as muscle and fiber as the animals that are going to observe.
Because it doesn't matter whether it's a cow or a robot who builds our buildings.
It doesn't matter how we built, what matters is what we build.
Architects already know how to make buildings more ecological and more intelligent and more kind.
We've been waiting for all of you to want them.
Finally, we're not on opposite side.
They find an architect, to control it and work together to make better buildings, better cities, for a better world, because there's a lot in play.
Buildings don't only reflect our society, but they shape it to the smallest spaces, local libraries -- households where we form our children, and the step of the bedroom.
Thank you very much.
This is my niece, Stan.
He just turned a year and he started walking.
And he does it in that cool way, typical of the children of a year, taking it, as if his body was moving too fast for their legs.
It's totally beautiful.
And one of the things that likes to do for the moment is to look at the mirror.
She really loves his reflection.
You laugh and church, and you give himself those big and fear bombs.
It's beautiful.
Apparently, all his friends do this and my mom tells me that I used to do it, and he made me think, when I stopped doing this?
How is it that we suddenly don't like our appearance?
Because apparently, we don't like.
Every month, 10,000 people search on Google, "Am I a family?
This is Faes, 13 years old and lives in Denness.
And as a teenager, it just wants to be loved and fit in.
It's Sunday at night.
It's preparing for next week in school.
It has a little bit of fear, it's a little bit confused, because, although his mom tells him the whole thing that is beautiful, every day in school, someone tells you it's ugly.
Between what his mom tells him and what his friends, or colleagues of school tell him, doesn't know who to believe.
So it makes it a video of her, put it on YouTube, and he asks others to please leave a comment -- "Am I nice or a famous?
Well, so far, Fall has received more than 13,000 comments in it.
Some of these are so decline, it doesn't even deserve to think about them.
We talk about a healthy teenager, normal and confident, who receives these answers in one of their most vulnerable life events.
Thousands of people are publishing videos like this, mostly teenage girls trying to communicate like this.
But what is it doing to do this?
Well, the teenagers today are almost never alone.
They're under the pressure of being online and available all the time, talking, chatting by saying, "I like to eat, share, sharing, publishing, this never ends.
We have never been so connected before, in a continuous way, so young.
As a mother told me, "It's like there's a party in your room every night.
There is simply no privacy.
And the social pressures that go from hand with that are implemented.
This environment, to be always connected, is addressing our children to adapt in the number of "I like you and the kinds of comments they get.
There is no division between an online life and real life.
It's really hard to know the differences between what it's real or what isn't.
And also, it's very hard to know the difference between what is authentic and what is manipulated directly.
What is the most declined in somebody's life in front of what it's normal in a daily context?
And where are they looking for the inspiration?
Well, you can see the kinds of images that are derived from the girls from now.
Blue models continue to dominate our passwords.
The technical technique is now a routine now.
And trends like, "Spring," Shirwani, Biological and Parkin.
For those of you who know, Project means prosperity.
These trends are associated with women in today's popular culture.
It's not hard to see what young people do.
But kids are not immune to this.
It's like the upper stars of the sport, and the stones are reconnecting.
But what's the problem with all this?
Well, surely we want our children to grow healthy and be individuals well balanced.
But in a culture obsessed by the image, we're teaching our children to devote more time and mental effort to their appearance, at the price of all the other aspects of their identity.
Things like their relationships, the development of their physical skills, their studies and other aspects start to suffer.
Six in 10 girls prefer not to do something because they think you don't see good enough.
These are not trivial activity.
They're fundamental activities for its growth as human beings and as contributes to society and the field of working development.
31 percent, almost one of three teenagers are not interested in the class debates -- they avoid to participate in classrooms because they don't want to call attention for their physical act.
One in five are not attending classes at all.
And in the testing season, if you don't think you see enough good enough, specifically if you don't think you're thin enough -- you will get a less note to the average of your peers, who don't worry about the appearance of appearance.
And this phenomenon has been generated in Finland, United States and China.
And it gets independently what these young people do.
So, to make it very clear, we're talking about how you see you, not how you really are.
The low self-esteem of his body is defining academic performance.
And it's also defining health.
The adolescents with a little bit of self-esteem make less physical activity, they eat less fruits and vegetables, they participate in more no healthy diet that they can bring them to a food mess.
They have low self-esteem.
They're more easily influenced by the people around them and they're mostly risk of depression.
And we think it's all about what they make more risky decisions, like alcohol and drug consumption, aesthetic diet, aesthetic surgery, aesthetic relationships to early ages and without protection and self-controller.
The pursuit of the perfect body is pushing the health system, and our government costs billions of dollars every year.
And we're not controlling it.
Women who believe they have overweight again, regardless of whether they have or don't have higher assembly rates.
17 percent of women don't present to a job interview in one day where they don't feel safe with the way they see.
Think about a moment in what this is doing to our economy.
If we could overcome this, what would that opportunity?
liberate this potential is from interest for each of us.
But how do we do that?
Well, speaking of itself, it doesn't take you very far.
Not enough.
If you really want to change things, you have to do something.
And we've learned that there are three key shapes, the first one is that we have to instill trust in their own body.
We have to help our teenagers develop strategies to overcome the pressure of perfect images and build their self-esteem.
The good news is that there are many programs available to do it.
The bad news is that most of these don't work.
I was very surprised when I learned that a lot of well-intentioned programs -- without realizing the situation.
So, we need to make sure that the program that our children follow not only will have a positive impact but also a lasting impact.
And research studies show that the best programs are focused on six key areas, the first is the influence of family, friends and relationships.
These six aspects are critical party points for any willing to provide education in body self-esteem that works.
One education is fundamental but facing this problem requires each of us to take the risks in the issue, and we are a better model to continue for women and girls in our own lives.
challenging the status of how women are seen and mentioned in our circles.
It's not good to tell the contribution of our politicians in hair cuts or the size of their legs, or to insist that the determination or success of an Olympic athlete depends on the fact that it's not a big beauty.
We need to start judge people so they are, not because they are seen.
All of us can start doing it by taking responsibility for the kinds of images and comments that we published in our social networks.
We can choose people based on their effort and their actions and not in their appearance.
And let me ask you, when was the last time you had a mirror.
In short, we have to work together as communities, as governments and as companies, to really change our culture, so that our children grow up valuing their entire person, valuing individuals, diversity, inclusion of it.
We have to put people who are really making a difference on a pedestrian.
To make a difference in the real world, let's make it all out of the big screen because we just create a different world.
A world where our children are free to become the best version of them, where the way they believe that they have never been able to be who they are, or what they want in their lives.
Think about what this can mean for someone in your lives.
Who is in mind?
To your wife.
To your sister.
To your daughter.
Is it your superconducting? Is his friend?
It could be just the woman who is two seats away. What would it mean for her if it was released from that authoritarian voice in his interior, that I urge you to have long legs -- more thin mosquitos, a more flat sea, feet smaller foot?
What would it mean for her if we knew this, and we would say stretched to its potential in that way?
Right now, the obsession of our culture with images is getting us all back to us.
But let's teach our kids the truth.
So let's show that the way you look at you is just a part of your identity, and that the truth is that we love them for those who are and what they do, and how they make us feel.
We include self-esteem in the curriculum of our schools.
We change each of us, the way we talk about and compared to other people.
And we work together as a community, from small groups to governments, so that the little travels of a year's age of today, they become agents of safe change of themselves.
Let's do it.
On November five, 1990, a gentleman named Elizabeth will come into a hotel in Manhattan and murder to the Rabbi Member Kahri, the leader of the Dependence of Department Descrip.
So we initially declared it innocent -- but being prisoners for other charges under each other, in company of others, they started planning attacks about 12 icons from New York including tunnels and synesthesia and the U.S. headquarters of the United Nations.
Fortunately, those plans were frustrated by an FBI informant report.
Sadly, the 1993 bomb in the World Trade Center, couldn't be avoided.
Later we will be convicted by his participation in that attention.
Elis is my father.
I was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1983, being him an Egyptian engineer, with a loving American mother, primary school teacher, among the two made all the possible for giving me a happy childhood.
Only when I was seven years old, our family started to change.
My father taught me a form of Islam that very few, including most Muslims, come to meet.
For experience, I saw that when people take time to interact, it doesn't require much to get to wish the same things in life.
However, in all of religion, in every human group, there is always a little fraction of people who are so deeply clinging to their convictions that think that you have to use all the means possible for everyone to live like them.
A few months before he got the arrest he sat with me and explained to me that in the last few weeks, he and some friends, had been going into a sign training in Long Island to practice.
He told me I would go with him the next day.
We came to the Sandwin Pollinator police that, without knowing our group, was made by the FBI.
When I got to throw my father out, my father helped me hold the record on the shoulder and explained how to aim the goal at about 30 meters.
That day, with the last bullet that I shot I gave to the little orange light on the goal, and for all of all, especially me, the whole goal is in flames.
My uncle turned to the others and in Arabic, he said "Evereatry Osama."
From such father, such son.
And all the comment was produced by a lot of laughter, but just a few years later, I understood what they were so funny.
They saw in me, the same level of destruction that my father could cause.
Those people later would be convicted to put a come up with 700 pounds of explosives in the underground space of the North Trade Center, causing an explosion that killed six people and I went to another 1,000.
I admired those men.
I called them "Magez: which means no.
When I turned 19, I had moved 20 times. That instability during my childhood was not allowed me to do many families.
Every time I started feeling comfortable about someone was already time to match and go to another city.
As it was always me the new face of the class with frequency was mathematicians.
I felt secret my identity to avoid being the white, but to be the new of the class, quiet and regulatory, was enough ammunition mentality.
So most of the time I was going to go home reading books, watching TV or playing games.
For these reasons, I didn't develop social skills, to say it super-seeing -- to grow under familiarity, I wasn't prepared for the real world.
I was educated to judge people, based on arbitrary indicators like their race or their religion.
So how could I open the eyes?
One of the first experiences that had been testing my way to think, was during the presidential elections of 2000.
In a presidential program I participated in the juvenile Venecuary Convention, in Philadelphia.
My group was focused on the subject of juvenile violence, as I had been a mathematical victim almost all my life, it was something that I felt so much passion.
The members of this group came from different processes.
One day, to the end of the convention -- I discovered that one of the kids who had made friendship, was Jewish.
It took several days to go out to the light, and I realized that there was no antibiotics between the two.
I had never had a Jewish friend before, and frankly, I was very proud to have been able to beat the barrier that all life had made me believe that it was innovative.
Another crucial moment came up when I got a summer job in Bush Garden, a amusement park.
I found myself with people from all kinds of beliefs and cultures, that experience was fundamental in the development of my character.
All of life had been taught to me that hospital was a sin and, by extension, all of the homes were bad influence.
By chance, I had the opportunity to work with homosexual actors there, in a show, and I could see that several of them were the most nice and less critical I've seen in life.
Having been accused of a child, I developed a sense of empathy to the suffering of others, but it wasn't easy for me to treat kind, exactly the way I would have wanted to be treated.
So I could hire the stereotypes that had taught me about a kid, with the experience of interaction in real life.
I don't know how that is to be homosexual, but I know what is being judged by something beyond my control.
Then the Dalai Share came from.
Every night, Jon Stewart made me become intellectually honest about my intuitions, and he helped me see that the race of people, religion or sexual orientation, have nothing to do with character.
And in many ways, he became my father in a moment where I was desperate to need it.
In occasion, inspiration can come from the unexpected. And that a Jewish comedian would have had a better influence in my life than my own father, extremism wasn't in vain.
One day I had a conversation with my mother about how I was changing my way to think, and she told me something that I would consider in my heart forever, while it's alive.
She looked at me with the eyes tired of someone who has suffered enough with an endless dollar and said, "I'm tired of hate."
At that time, I realized how much negative energy you need to keep all that hatred into your inside.
My real name is not Z European.
He changed it when my family decided to break my relationship with my father and start a new life.
So why decided to go out and put me in a risk part?
Well, it's simple.
I've done it because I hope somebody who is trying to lead to violence, can hear my story and understand that there is a better path, than even though I was invited to this violent ideology and intelligent, I didn't get a lot of fun.
On the contrary, I decided to use my experience to fight terrorism and against the pressures.
I do it for the victims of terrorism and for their loved ones, by the terrible pain and the losses that terrorism has produced them in their lives.
For the victims of terrorism speaking, against those meaningless acts as I reject the actions of my father.
And with this simple I'm showing you here as proof that violence is not inherent to any religion or race -- that children don't have to follow their parents.
I'm not my father.
Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.
At this point, there is a film that's projected in their minds.
It's an incredible multiplement movie.
It's in 3D, and it has surface sound of what you hear and see right now. But that's just the beginning.
Your film has a lot, taste and texture.
Feel your body, your pain, your hunger, your pleasure.
It has emotions, angry and happiness.
It has memories, as moments of your childhood who are projecting to your eyes.
And it has constantly an superimposed voice in your conscious thinking.
The heart of the movie is you who experience everything in direction.
This film is your flow of consciousness, the subject of the experience of mind and the world.
Consciousness is one of the fundamental truths of the human being.
Each of us is conscious.
We all have an internal movie, you and you and you.
There's nothing we know more directly.
At least I know I have a consciousness.
I have no certainty that you are aware of.
Consciousness is also the reason to live.
If we were not aware of it, nothing in our lives would make sense or value.
But at the same time, it's the most mysterious phenomenon in the universe.
Why are we conscious?
Why do we have these internal films, right?
Why are we not just robots that we get to produce results without experiencing the entire movie film?
At this point, nobody knows the answers to those questions.
I suggest that to integrate consciousness to science, you need some radical ideas.
Some people say it's impossible for consciousness science.
Science, by nature, is goal.
Consciousness, by nature, is subjective.
So there can never be a science of consciousness.
Because for almost all the 20th century, I lost that vision.
The psychology studied behavior targets, the neuroscience studied the brain objectively but no one mentioned the consciousness.
Even 30 years ago, when TED started, there were very few scientific jobs about consciousness.
Then, 20 years ago, everything started to change.
neuroscientists like Francis Crick and physicists like Roger Pen said, "Now it's time for science to tackle consciousness.
And since then, there was a real explosion, a science of scientific work about consciousness.
And this work was fantastic. It was great.
But it also has fundamental limitations to the moment.
The center of consciousness science in recent years was the pursuit of correlations between correlations between some areas of the brain and some states of consciousness.
We saw some of this guy in the fantastic work that Nancy Kansas presented a few minutes ago.
We now understand much better, for example, the areas of the brain that are related to the conscious experience of seeing faces or feeling happy or feeling happy.
But this is still a science of correlations here.
It's not a science of explanation.
We know that these areas of the brain are related to certain kinds of conscious experiences, but we don't know why.
I'd like to explain it by saying that this kind of neuroscience work responds to some questions that we want to explain the consciousness, the questions about what makes certain areas of the brain and what they correlate with.
But in a sense, those are the easy problems.
No offense to neuroscientists.
Actually, there are no easy problems with consciousness.
Because I don't address the true central mystery of this matter, why all physical process in the brain has to be accompanied by consciousness.
Why is there a sustainable international?
Right now, we can't understand it.
And you can say, let's take a few years to neuroscience.
It's going to become another emerging phenomenon, like the chemicals, like the humanity, like life, and we're going to find explanation.
The typical endeavors are all cases of emerging behaviors, how the electronics operate -- how the hurricane works, how they reproduce, they adapt and they metabolized living organisms -- they're all questions about objective function.
That could be applied to the human brain to explain some behaviors and the functions of the human brain as an emerging phenomenon, how we walk, how we talk about, how do we play chess -- they're all questions about behavior.
But when it comes to consciousness, the questions about behavior are among easy problems.
But the hard problem, is the question of why is it that every behavior is accompanied from a subjective experience?
And here is, the standard paradigm of the emergence, the standard paradigm of neuroscience, actually doesn't have much to say.
I'm a heart scientific material.
I want a scientific theory of the automatic that it works. For a long time, I hit my head against the wall looking for a theory of consciousness in pure physical terms.
But at the end I got to the conclusion that it didn't work for systematic reasons.
I think we stand at this point.
We have a chain of wonderful explanations -- general explanations -- we used to do this -- physics explains chemistry, chemistry explains biology, biology explains part of psychology.
But consciousness doesn't seem to fit in this scheme.
On the one hand, it's a fact that we are conscious.
On the other, we don't know how to accommodate that idea to our scientific vision of the world.
I think consciousness right now, it's a kind of anomaly -- something we need to integrate to our vision of the world, but we don't still know how.
With an anomaly like this, you can need radical ideas, I think we need ideas that at the beginning will seem crazy, before you can deal with consciousness in a scientific way.
There are some possibilities for those crazy ideas.
My friend Dan Dennett, who's here today, has one.
His crazy idea is that there is no hard problem of consciousness.
The whole idea of the internal subjective movie includes a kind of illusion or confusion.
Actually, what you have to do, is to explain the objective functions -- the behaviors of the brain, and so it studies everything that needs explanation.
Well, more power for him.
That's the kind of radical idea that we need to explore if we want to have a theory of purely disruptive consciousness based on the brain.
At the same time, for me and for many others, that vision is pretty close to simply deny that the observation of consciousness is satisfying.
But I am in a different direction.
And I want to explore two crazy ideas that I think can be promise.
The first crazy idea is that consciousness is critical.
physicists sometimes take some aspects of the universe as fundamental leaders, space, time and mass.
They sell fundamental laws that governments, like the laws of gravity or quantum mechanics.
These laws and properties are not explained in terms of nothing else.
On the contrary, they are considered fundamental and that's where the world is built.
Sometimes the list of the fundamental is clear.
In the 19th century, Marker discovered that you can't explain electromagnetic phenomena in terms of fundamental concepts in terms of predictable fundamental concepts -- space, time, mass laws -- so I put the basic laws of the electronics, and then you put the electric charge as a fundamental concept that those laws governance.
I think that's the situation that we find with consciousness.
If you can't explain consciousness in terms of fundamental ideas, space space, time, mass charge, then because of logic, you have to fold the list.
The most natural thing would be to boost consciousness itself as a fundamental thing, a fundamental brick of nature.
This doesn't mean that suddenly it's not the object of science.
It opens up the path to manage it scientifically.
So what we need is to study the fundamental laws that govern consciousness, the laws that connect consciousness with other fundamental concepts -- space, time, mass, physical processes.
physicists sometimes say that we want fundamental laws so simple that we can store them in a first one.
The situation of consciousness is something like this.
We want to find fundamental laws that we can store in a t-shirt.
We still don't know what laws are, but that's what we look for.
The second crazy idea is that consciousness can be universal.
Every system can have a degree of consciousness.
This vision sometimes called penaltyments, "Pause for everyone, "Paradoxia for mind, every system is conscious -- not only humans, the dogs, the mice, the flies -- even the Rob Knife microbes -- the elementary particles.
Even a photography has some degree of consciousness.
The idea is not that photons are smart or think.
It's not that a pilot can be full of anguish when you think, "Oh, always traveling at the speed of light.
I can never slow up and smell the rewards."
No, so no.
But the thought is that perhaps photons can have some element of credit feeling, subjective feeling, some primitive precursor of consciousness.
This can sound a little bit crazy for you.
How do anybody think something so mass?
Part of this comes from the first crazy idea, that consciousness is a fundamental thing.
If it's fundamental -- like space, time and mass, it's natural to assume that it can also be universal, just like others.
It's also worth noticing that even though the idea seems like, it's much less for the people of different cultures, where the human mind seems more a continuum to nature.
A deeper reason comes from the idea that perhaps the simplest and powerful way of finding fundamental laws that relate to the thinking of the physical process, is linking awareness with information.
Whenever there is information processing -- there's consciousness.
The process of complex information, like in a human being, complex consciousness.
Simple information processing, simple consciousness.
Something very exciting is that in recent years a neuroscientist, Gillian Tongous, took this kind of theory and developed it with mathematical methods.
It has a mathematical measure of information integration, which is called Ph.D. that measures the degree of integrated information in a system.
And I'm supposed to do with consciousness.
So in a human brain, there's an incredible degree of information integration, a high degree of phone, a lot of consciousness.
In a mouse there is a degree of information integration of information, as much significant -- very important awareness.
But when you get to the lamps, microbes microbes, particles, the degrees of Ph.D.
The level of information integration is less, but it's not zero either.
In Tony theory, there will still be a different awareness level of zero.
It actually provides a fundamental law of consciousness -- high degree of philosopher, high degrees of consciousness.
Also, another reason is that penalty can help us integrate consciousness to the physical world.
physicists and philosophers have often observed that physics is curiously abstract.
It describes the structure of reality using a lot of equations, but it doesn't talk to us about the reality that underlies below.
As Stephen Hawking, "Where does the fire of the equations come from?
From the psychic view, the equations of physics can be left as they are, but they can use to describe the flow of consciousness.
That's what physicists do basically -- describe the flow of consciousness.
According to this vision, consciousness is the one that puts fire in the equations.
In that vision, consciousness is not out of the physical world as a kind of addiction.
It's right there in the center.
This vision, I believe, is the police vision, has the potential to transfer our relationship to nature, and it can have social consequences and very serious ethical consequences.
Some can be logical.
I used to think that I shouldn't eat anything that had consciousness, then I had to be avan.
If you're a phone and you accept that vision, you will have a lot of hunger.
I think this tends to transform your vision, while what matters in ethical terms and moral conditions, it's not so much the fact of consciousness, but its importance and complexity.
It's also natural to ask for consciousness in other systems, like computers.
What about the Amazon artificial intelligence system in the "Finger movie, "Hey?
Is it conscious?
According to the view of psychiatric information, she has a complicated information processing so that the answer is yes, if it's aware of it.
If this is right, they have a pretty serious ethical problem on the ethic of the development of smart computer systems and the ethics of supporting them.
Finally, you can ask for the consciousness of complete collective collective the planet.
Canada has its own consciousness.
Or at a more local level, an integrated group, like the audience in a TED Talk, right now, we have a TED collective awareness -- an internal movie for this whole group of TED, different from the internal movies of each of the parts.
I don't know the answer to that question, but I think at least it's a question that needs to be serious.
So this picture of pieces, it's a radical vision, and I don't know if it's right.
I'm actually safer than the first crazy idea, that consciousness is a fundamental thing, that from the second, that it's universal.
The vision raises a lot of questions, many challenges, like, how those bits of thinking contribute to the kind of complex consciousness we know and love.
If we can answer those questions, then I think we go through the right path to a theory of serious awareness.
If not, well, probably this is the hardest problem of science and philosophy.
We can't wait to solve it overnight.
But I think we'll finally be able to find it out.
Understanding consciousness is the real key, I think, to understand the universe and to understand ourselves.
Maybe we just need the right idea.
Thank you.
I grew up in a little rural village in Victoria.
I had a very normal profile, a low school profile.
I went to school, I got together with my friends, I fought my younger sisters.
Everything was very normal.
And when I was 15 years old, a member of my community came up to my parents because I wanted to name for a community prize.
And my parents said, "Well, that's very nice, but there's an obvious problem.
She's actually not getting anything."  And they were right.
I went to school, I had good grades. After school, I had a low profile in my mother's row, and I spent a lot of time looking at the Valley Salmon Valley and Danish Creature."
Yeah, I did. I know.
But they were right.
I didn't do anything that was extraordinary at all.
Nothing that can consider as an achievement if we take the disability outside the equation.
Years later, being in the second part of the teaching in a high school in Mellony, just after about 20 minutes in the class 11 of the legal studies, a guy raised his hand and said, "Hey, when you give your speech?
And I said, "What discuss?
Well, I had been talking about the dance law for some good 20 minutes.
And he said, "You know, your motivation speech.
When people in the wheelchair, they talk about inspiring things in school?
Usually in the acts of acts."
And it was then when I realized, this kid had had experiences with disabled people like inspiration objects.
And we don't. And it's not guilty of the guy, which is true for many of us.
For us, people with disability are not our teachers or our doctors or our manipulations.
We're not real people. We're there to inspire it.
And, in fact, I'm in this stage looking at what I do in this wheelchair, and probably you're waiting for you to inspire you. Right?  Yes.
Well, ladies and gentlemen, I'm afraid to tell you startling.
I'm not here to inspire you.
I'm here to tell you that we have lied to disability.
Yes, they have sold us the lie that disability is something wrong, to a mass, M.
It's a bad thing and living with a disability makes you great.
It's not a bad thing, and it doesn't make any exception.
And in the last few years, we've been able to spread even more of this lie through social media.
You may have seen images like this: "The only disability in life is a bad authority."
Or this one: "Your excuse is invisible."
Or this other one: "Before you go down, intelligence."
These are just a couple of examples, but there is a lot of them.
You may have seen one of the girl without hands drawing with a pencil sustained by the mouth.
You may have seen a child who runs with lost carbon fiber legs.
And there's a lot of these images, which are what we call porn inspiration.
And I use the porn term deliberately because they have a group of people for the benefit of another group of people.
So in this case, we put the disabled.
The purpose of these images is to inspire them, to motivate them, so that we can see them and think, "Well, as bad as my life, it could be worse.
I could be that person.
But what if you're that person?
I've lost the numbers of the number of times that have been strangers me wanting to express that you think I'm brave or an inspiration source, and this happened before my work had a public profile.
It was like I'm happy to wake up in the morning and remember my own name.  And this is to happen.
These images, those images cost people with disabilities.
They're there so you can see them and think that things aren't so bad for you, or to put your concerns in perspective.
And life as a disabled person is actually something hard.
So we put some things out.
But the things we know is not the things that you can think.
They're not relative to our bodies.
I use the term "People Disability, deliberately because I subscribe to the social model of disability, which tells us that we are more disabled, because of the society that we live than because of our bodies or diagnostics.
So I've lived in this body for a long time.
I'm very excited about him.
It does the things that I need to do, and I've learned how to take the best of your ability as well as you do, and that's what happens with the children of those pictures as well.
They're not doing anything outside the common.
They're just using their bodies by taking the best of their ability.
So is it really fair to solve them in the way we do it, by sharing those pictures?
When people say, "You're an inspiration source -- it tells you as a complete.
And I know why it happens.
It's because of the lie, because they've sold us this lie that disability makes us great.
And, honestly, it isn't.
And I know what you're thinking.
I'm here pushing the inspiration and you think, "Oh God, Shandlera, aren't you sometimes inspired by something?
And actually, I know I am.
I learn from other people with disability at all.
However, I don't learn that I'm more lucky than them.
I learn that this is a great idea to use some baby panels to pick up the things that are leaving.  And I learn the ingenious trick of how to load the battery of the mobile phone on the battery of the chair.
Great.
We learn from force and resilience of others, not against our bodies and our diagnosis, but against a world that exclusive and considered us.
I really believe that that lie that have sold us about disability is the biggest injustice.
It makes us hard life.
And that quote: "The only disability in life is a bad antibiotic: the reason that that's the lie is because it's not true, because of the social model of disability.
A lot of smiles in front of a staircase has never done that becomes a radio.
Never    smiling to a television screen will not get the subtitles for the deaf people.
Not a lot of people in the middle of a bookstore and raising a positive attitude to convert all those books to the ball.
It's simply not going to happen.
I want to really live in a world where disability is not exception, but the norm.
I want to live where a 15 year-old girl, sitting in his bedroom watching "Baby the Vaeron the Valley Saltands don't deserve anything to be in a chair.
I want to live in a world where we don't have so low expectations of people with disability that we are happy to get out of bed and remember our names in the morning.
I want to live in a world where we value the genuine achievement of people with disabilities. And I want to live in a world where a kid from 11 degrees in high school in a high school in Mellony is not a little bit surprised that their new teacher is a wheelchair chair.
Disappointment doesn't make us exceptional -- but questioning what you think you know about it does it.
Thank you.
What do you have to do is the augmented reality and the professional football with empathy.
And what is the average speed of a collaborator without charge?
Unfortunately, today I'm just going to answer one of those questions, so please, you don't get apart.
When people think about augmented reality, they think of "Minority Republican, and in Tom Cruise handing hands in the air, but the augmented reality is not science fiction.
The augmented reality is something that will happen in our days and happen because we have the tools for it, and people need to know, because the augmented reality will change our lives as much as the Internet and mobile phones.
So how do we get to the augmented reality?
The first step is what I wear poster: Google Glass.
I'm sure many of them are familiar with them.
What you might not know is that the Google Glass are a device that allows them to see what I see.
I'll allow you to experience what is being a professional sports in the field.
Right now, the only way to be in the field is that I try to describe them.
I have to use words.
I have to create a framework that you will fill with your imagination.
We can use Google Glass, underneath a helmet and know what is running through the game field at 100 miles, the blood hitting your ears.
We can know that a man in 100 pounds is chasing us, trying to get us all over the place.
I've been there and I assure you that it's not nice.
I bring some videos to show you what the Google Glass, under the helmet and give you an idea of that.
Unfortunately, it's not images of the NFL practices, because the idea of the NEA of emerging technology is a submarine coming up to the surface. But we do what we can.
So let's look at a video.
Chris Luck," let's go.
It's horrible to be documented.
A moment. Let's zoom in a little bit.
Are you preparing?
Go!
Chris Luka," as you can see, is a probability of what is being documented in the football field, from the perspective of the player.
You may have realized that lack people, the rest of the team.
We have a video of them, cut from the University of Washington.
Fatal factory: mice. Rather Randoms."
Blue eight, Blue eight."
Chris Luck," this is a little bit more to the feeling to be in the field, but it has nothing to do with being at the NEA.
The fans want that experience.
The fans want to be in the field, to be their favorite players, and they've asked me on YouTube and Twitter -- you can see from the angle of a ship market.
A current?
We want to experience that."
Once we have that experience with Google and Google Glass, how do we get it out of the flash -- how do we take it to the next level?
We took it at that level using something called Occupations Richard, which surely many already know.
The Rio Rio has been described as the most realistic virtual reality device ever, and it's not cheap word.
And I'm going to teach you why, with this video.
Man: Oh, oh.
No, no, no! I don't want to keep playing. No!
Oh, my God! Ah!
CK: That's the experience of a man in a Russian mountain having his life.
What will be the experience of a fan when we recorded a video of Adrian Peter crossing the line, getting rid of a dolphin with the arm before they run and do an analysis? What will be the experience of a fan fail.
When I can be Moses running through the cockroach, launching the ball at the bottom of the network? Or will I have a search in William?
What will be your experience when you go down a mountain to more than 100 miles as an Olympic hero?
Maybe you increase the sales of diapers for adults.
But this is not even augmented reality.
It's just virtual reality, R.C.
How do we get augmented reality, R."
We will reach the augmented reality when the coaches and the melodims and the owners see the information of what people want to see and think, "How do we use this to improve our teams?
How do we use it to win parties?
Because they always use technology to win.
They like to win. They give them money.
So, here is a brief refresher on technology at the NEA.
In 1965, the Balk People put a market to their field market to play faster.
They won the Super Bowl that year.
Other teams decided to imitate them.
More people saw the party because it was more exciting, faster.
In 1994, the NNA put radio in the fields of the field of field and after the defense.
They had more viewers because it was faster, more fun.
In 2013, imagine that they are a player coming back to their group and you see their next shot shown in front of you, in a plastic bombsight that you have -- you don't have to worry about forget a game.
or to memorize the strategy.
Just come out to the field and react.
And the coaches want it because if they don't follow their instructions, they lose parachute, and they hate losing parachute.
If you lose parties they leave you as a coach.
And they don't want that.
But the augmented reality is not just a manual strategy manual.
The augmented reality is also a way to collect information and use it in real time to improve your way to play the game.
How would it go?
Well, a very simple option would be to have a camera in every street corner having a view from the high of the people who are down.
You also get information from the sensors and the accelerators -- something that's already working already.
And all that information is sent to your players.
The good teams will be able to send it.
The bad ones will have information overload.
This will differentiate the good teams of evil.
So your team of computing will be as important as your records, and the data analysis will stop being just for nervous.
It will also be for sports. Who would have imagined it?
What would it be like in the country?
Imagine you're the field of field.
You get the bullet and you go back.
You look for an open receptor. All of a sudden, a block on the left side of your bombsight is missing you that a defense behind you is going to attack you, normally you wouldn't see it, but the L.A. system gets you.
You move to the protection area.
Another flag is missing you that there's an open receptor.
You toss the ball.
And the bullet loses the trajectory.
You don't know where to land. However, the receptor sees in their bombsight an area of grass that lights and can modify the race.
You know, you go through the balance and go up and analyze.
The public comes up and the fans have followed the game from each angle.
This is something that will create massive emotion in the game.
I'll make lots of people look at it, because people want to live that experience.
The fans want to be in the field.
They want to be your favorite player.
The augmented reality will be part of the sports because it's too profitable to not be.
But what I ask you is: Do we want this to be the only use of reality?
Are we going to use it just as bread and circus -- like our usual entertainment.
Because I think we can use it for something else.
I think we can use the augmented reality to promote empathy between human beings, to show someone how it is, literally, being in another person's place.
We know what this technology is worth for sports lights.
It generates billions of income a year.
But how much is this technology for a teacher in the classroom trying to show a auditorium how damaged their actions are from the perspective of victim?
How much is this technology for a gay in Uganda or Russia trying to show the world how you live being performed?
How much is it also for a Harvard David or a Neil Reagan Task trying to inspire a generation of children to think more about space and science instead of quarterly notes and Karachic?
Ladies and gentlemen, the augmented reality is coming.
The questions that we make, the decisions we take and the challenges that we face, they depend on us.
Thank you.
I recently retired after 23 years of service at the High Pale of California.
Most of those 23 years I spent the south end of the southern County County, which includes the Golden Gate bridge.
The bridge is an iconic structure, known by their beautiful views of San Francisco, the Pacific Ocean and its antibiotic style.
Unfortunately, it's also a magnet for suicide, being one of the most used places in the world.
The Golden Gate Bridge was open in 1973.
Joseph Steve, the chief engineer, commissioned to build the bridge, said that, "The bridge is basically testing suicide.
The suicide from the bridge is not practical nor profession."
But from his openness, over 1,500 people have jumped into death from that bridge.
Some of you believe that traveling between the two towers will take you to another dimension, this bridge has been identified as such, such that the fall of it frees up from all your concerns and pain, and the water that goes below you will clean your soul.
But let me tell you that happens when the bridge is used to commit suicide.
After a quarter of four to five seconds, the body picks up against the water about 120 miles an hour.
The impact breaks the bone, some of which they prefer vital organs.
Most of them die in the impact.
Those of you who don't usually fall into the middle water, and then they drop.
I don't think that the people who are telling this method of suicide is realizing the magic that you will face.
This is the cable here.
Except around two towers, there are 32 parallel steel inch to the bridge.
This is where most people are in front of the life of life.
I can tell you for experience that once the person is on that edge, and at the darker moment, it's very hard to bring them back.
I took this picture last year while this young man spoke to an officer contemplating his life.
I want to tell you with joy that we had success that day to bring it back into the ship.
When I started working on the bridge, we didn't have any formal training.
We struggled to channel the way through these calls.
This was not just a bad service to those who control suicide, but the officers as well.
We've traveled a long way since then.
Today, veteran officials and psychologists train new officials in the office.
This is Jason Garden.
I met him on July 22, last year when you receive a so-called possible suicide system sitting in the heart near the center.
And I said, and when I arrived, I looked at Jason talking to an official of the Golden Gate bridge.
Jason was only 32 years old, and he had flown up here from New Jersey.
In fact, I had flown up to here twice before New Jersey to try to kill me from this bridge.
After about an hour talking to Jason -- we asked if we knew the story of the Pandora's box.
remembering the Greek mythology. Zero created Panden, and he sent her to Earth with a box, and he said, "You never, never open that box.
Well, one day, curiosity could more than Pandora, and she opened the box.
They came out of it, permission, and all kinds of evil against the man.
The only good thing in the box was hope.
So Jason asked us, "What happens if you open the box and there is no hope.
It stopped a few instances, leaned on the right, and it was.
This very clever and intelligent guy in New Jersey had just taken my life.
I talked to Jason that night, and I guess when I was talking to them, I didn't seem to be ringing very well, because the next day, the family rabbi called me to see how it was.
Jason parents had asked it.
So the colors of suicide affect a lot of people.
And I posed these questions: What would you do if a member of your family, a friend or somebody loved out of suicide?
What would you say?
You would know what to say?
In my experience, not only do you have to talk, but you need to listen.
Listening to understanding.
Don't argue, customers, or tell the person you know how you feel, because you probably don't know.
Just being there, you can be the tipping point you need.
If you think somebody is suicide, you have no fear to confront them and ask the question.
One way to ask you the question is, Others in similar circumstances have thought about ending their life -- you've had these thoughts, thinking?
To confront the person in front of the front can save life and be the inflection point for them.
Other signs to look, despair, believe that things are terrible and they're never going to improve it, importance, believe that there is nothing you can do about it -- a recent social isolation and a loss of interest in life.
I came up with this talk just a couple of days ago, and I got an email from a lady and I'd like to read her letter.
She lost her son on January 19 of this year, and he wrote this email just a couple of days ago, and it's with his permission and blessing that I read it.
"Hello, Kevin -- I think you're at TED conference.
It must be a whole experience there.
I'm thinking that I should go foot to the bridge this week.
I just wanted to leave a note.
I hope you can tell many people and go home talking about it to their friends who tell their friends, etc.
I'm still pretty unhappy, but notice more moments of realizing that Mike will not come home.
Mike was driving from Peter to San Francisco to see the party of the 49 with his father the 19 of January.
It never got there.
I called the Police police and reported it as a decline that night.
On the next morning, two officers came to my house, and they reported me that Mike car was down in the bridge.
A witness had seen him jump from the bridge at 1850 from the day before.
Thank you very much for fight for those who can be temporarily weak to fight themselves.
Who hasn't been before wrong without suffering a real mental illness.
It shouldn't be so easy to end with it.
My prayers are with you for your struggle.
The GG: The Golden Gate Bridge is supposed to be a passage through our beautiful bay, not a cemetery.
Good luck this week, Victoria."
I can't imagine the value that she needed to go to the bridge and go through the path that her son took that day, and also the value to come out ahead.
I'd like to introduce you to a man who I mean with hope and value.
On March 11, 2005, I responded to a radio call by a possible subject in the bridge of the bridge near the north tower.
I drove my bike, and I looked at this man, Kevin Berkeley, standing on the sidewalk.
When I saw me, he crossed the ship, and he stopped in that little tube that goes around the tower.
For the next hour, I heard as Kevin talked about his depression and despair.
Kevin decided by his account that day will come back on that lane and give life another opportunity.
When Kevin came back, happiness.
"This is a new beginning, a new life."
But I asked him, "What did it make you come back and give the hope and life another opportunity?
And you know what he told me?
He said, "You listen to me.
You let me talk and just listen to it."
Shortly after that incident, I got a letter from the mother of Kevin, and I have that letter with me, and I would like to read it.
"Dear Brisan, nothing erase the events of March 11, and you're one of the reasons why Kevin follows with us.
And honestly, I think Kevin was claiming by help.
It's been diagnosed with a mental disease for which has been properly medicine.
I adopted Kevin when I had only six months, completely unconscious of all of those terrifying traits -- but thank God, we now know it.
Kevin is in order, as he said.
We thank God for you.
I was constantly in debt with you, Narrator Berkeley."
And in the end, she wrote, "D." When I visited San Francisco Hospital that night, you figure out the patient.
"I know I had to fix it."
Today, Kevin is an active father and an active member of society.
He speaks openly about the events of that day and his depression with hope that their story will inspire others.
The suicide is not just something I've found in the work.
It's personal.
My grandfather was suicide with poison.
That act, despite finishing their own pain, I stole the opportunity to know.
This is what suicide.
For most of the suicide people, or those who consider suicide, they wouldn't think about hurt another person.
They just want their own pain to go.
Usually this is achieved only three things: sleep, drugs or alcohol or death.
In my career, I have responded and I've been involved in hundreds of mental diseases and sales around the bridge.
Of those incidents that I've been directly involved in, I've only lost two, but those two are too much.
One was Jason.
The other was a man who talked about about an hour.
During that time, I shook my hand in three times.
At the end of the day, he looked at me, and he said, Kevin, sorry, but I have to go."
And he jumped out.
Horrible, absolutely awful.
I want to tell you, though, that the vast majority of the people that we get to contact in that bridge is not suggested.
Also, those few who have jumped out of the bridge and lived and you can talk about it, that one percent or two percent, most of those people have said that the second one who left the salary realized they had made a mistake and they wanted to live.
I tell people, the bridge not only connects Mars with San Francisco, but also people.
That connection, or bridge that we do, is something that all and every one of us should be striving for doing.
The suicide can prevent you.
There's help. There's hope.
Thank you very much.
The world makes them what you're not, but in your inner you know what you are, and a question is bringing you, how do you become that?
I have to be something unique in that sense, but I'm not alone, in any way I'm alone.
When I became a model I felt that he had finally achieved the dream that he had since a child.
My outside finally ran with my inner truth, with my inner self.
For complicated reasons, what I'm going to refer later, when I look at this picture I think, you get Gene, you get it, you get it.
But last October, I found that I'm just beginning to go.
We all love our families, our religion, our society, our moment in history, even our bodies.
Some of you have the value of freedom, to get rid of the limitations imposed by the color of skin or the beliefs of the people around us.
They are people who are always challenging the status quo.
In my case, the last nine years, many of my neighbors, many of my friends, my agent, including my story.
I think this line is called revenue.
This is my own.
I was recorded as a girl at birth because of the appearance of my genital people.
I remember my five years in the Philippines, in my house, I always took this t-shirt in my head.
And my mom asked me, "Why do you always take that t-shirt in your head?
I said, "Mom, it's my hair. I'm a girl."
I knew how to self-interest.
The gender has always considered an immune fact, but now we know that it's more complex and missiled.
Because of my success, I never dared to share my story, not because I thought I'm wrong, but why the world deals with those of us who want to liberate us.
Every day I appreciate to be a woman.
I have mom, dad and a family who accepted me as I am.
Many are not so lucky.
There's a long tradition in the Asian culture that celebrates the mystery of gender.
There's a Buddhist goddess of compassion.
There is a Hindu goddess of the windows.
And when I was eight years old, I was at a party in the Philippines who celebrated these mysteries.
I was in front of the stage, and I remember that this beautiful woman appeared to me, and I remember that moment as if something hit me, this is the kind of woman I want to be.
And when I was 15 years old, when I still had a man, I met this woman called T.A.
It is the director of a bridge of transformation behavior.
That night, she asked me, "Why haven't you been involved in the beauty conference?
He told me that if I participated her, she would get out of the password spending and the walkable window, and that night, he won on bathroom suit, and he was a third end of the more than 40 candidates.
That moment changed my life.
Suddenly, I was inside the world of beauty regions.
Not a lot of people can say that their first work was of beauty of beautiful women, but I can.
I also met the damage of the disaster, especially when we traveled to remote provinces of the Philippines.
But more importantly, I met my best friends in that community.
In 2001 my mom, who had moved to San Francisco, called me and told me that they passed my request from the green card that could go to the United States.
I was scared.
I said to my mother, "Mars, I'm fun.
I'm here with friends, I like to travel and be a beauty queen recent."
But then, two weeks later, she called me and said, "You know if you move to the United States you can change the name and the identity of gender.
It was all I needed to hear.
My mom suggested to me that he would put two and my name.
She also accompanied me when I was in Thailand at the age of 19 years.
It's curious that in some of the most rural cities in Thailand they perform the most prestigious surgery, sophisticated and safe.
At that time in the United States, it was necessary to be able to make surgery before they change the name and the gender.
So in 2001 I went to San Francisco, and I remember looking at the driving license with the name Gene and the "Fla: female gender.
It was a great moment.
For some people, their identity means to be able to drive or be able to get a trick, but for me it was the license to live, to feel dignity.
Suddenly, my fears looked minimum.
I felt that I could conquer my dream and move to New York, and be model.
Many are not so lucky.
I think of this woman of Haliant Allenders.
A young woman in New York who brave his truth, but she was shown, he ended his life.
For many of my community, that's the reality that they live.
Our suicide rates are eight times higher than the rest of the population.
All 20 of November, we do a global surveillance by the Carnegie Day of the Transformation.
I'm on this stage thanks to a long story of people who fought and stood up to injustice.
These are Marshall P. Johnson and Sylvia River.
Today, right now, I'm coming out of the closet.
I can't keep living my truth alone and just to me.
I want to do the best to help others live their truth without shame.
I'm here, exposing me, so that some day no longer there are any more vegetables of Novator.
My deepest truth led me to accept what I am.
Would you do that?
Thank you very much.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.  KT: Gene, a quick question.
Gene Rock," of course. You see, first, thank you with all my bloods.
To my support network, my parents, especially my family, who itself is very strong.
I remember all the times I have been to young women translated, who I had left, and sometimes when they called me and told me that his parents couldn't accept it, I took the phone, he called my mom and said, "Mommy, can you call this woman?
Sometimes it worked, other not. It's just gender identity, that's what is in the center of what we are, right?
I mean, everybody assigned us a gender at birth, and what I try to do is put on the topic that some of the time that is sometimes a little bit of assignment, and that should be a space that would allow people to sell, and this is a conversation that we should have with parents, with colleagues.
The transformation movement is starting compared to gay motion.
There's still a lot of work to do.
It should have been understood.
There should be space for curiosity and asking questions, and I hope you all be my allies.
KS: Thank you. Very nice. GG: Thank you.
In many patriarchal and tribal societies, parents generally know them for their children, but I'm one of the few parents who are known by their daughter and I'm proud of it.
Malawi started his campaign for education defending their rights in 2007, and when they were holding their efforts in 2011, when they were giving the National Peace Project of peace, it became very famous -- a very popular girl in his country.
Before that, it was my daughter, but now I'm his father.
Ladies and gentlemen, if we look at the history of humanity, the history of women is the history of injustice.
You see, in the patriarchal societies, right from the beginning, when when you're born a girl, your birth is not celebrate.
It's not welcome -- not for your father or his mother.
The neighborhood comes in to the mother and nobody happy to the father.
And a mother is overwhelmed for having a girl.
When it gives birth to the first child, the first daughter, he gets sad.
When it gives birth to the second daughter, it was commonly, and with the hope of a child, when he used his third daughter, it feels guilty as a criminal.
Not only the mother suffers -- but the daughter -- the daughter is born when growing up, it has as well.
At the age of five years, when I should go to school, she stays home and school and she admitted to his brother.
Until 12 years old, in some way, it has a good life.
It can be fun.
It can play with your friends on the street, and it can move through the streets as a butterfly.
But when it comes into the adolescence, when it comes to 13 years old, it was banned to come out of his house without a male computer.
It's confined to the four walls of their house.
It's no longer a free person.
It becomes the call of his father and his brothers and his family, and if you transfer the code of that honor, I could even kill it.
And it's interesting that this code of honor, not only affect the life of a girl, also affects the life of male members of family.
So this brother, sacrificed the joy of his life and happiness of his sisters in the name of the honor.
And there is a norm more of the patriarchal societies called the objectivity.
A good girl is supposed to be very quiet, very humble and very substance.
It's the criterion of it.
The model of a good girl must be quiet.
It's supposed to be silent and accept the decisions of their father and your mother and decisions of the elderly even if they don't want.
If you marry it with a man who doesn't like or if you marry it with an old man, he has to accept it, because it doesn't want to be unexpected to desert.
If you marry it, you have to accept it.
Otherwise, you call it depressing.
And what about the end?
In the words of a poet, "The Haraches, they love it, and then it gives birth to more children and daughters."
And the irony of the situation is that this mother, including the same lesson for his daughter and the same lesson of honor to their children.
And this vicious circle continues and continues.
dear brothers and sisters, when Malawi was born, and for the first time, believe me, I don't like the newly born nations, to be honest, but when I was there and looked at his eyes, believe me, I was extremely honored.
And so much before I was born, I thought about her name, and I was fascinated with a legendary fight of freedom in Afghanistan.
His name was Malawi from Madagascar, and he called my daughter like that.
But when I looked up, everyone was men, and I grab my pen, and I brought a line from my name, and I wrote, "Mayor."
And when she grew up, when I was four and a half years old, I admitted her in my school.
You might wonder, why should I mention the admit of a girl in a school?"
Yeah, I must mention it.
You can take it for granted in Canada, in the United States, in many developing countries, but in the poor countries, in patriarchal societies, in tribal societies, it's a great event for the life life.
In fact, in a school means the recognition of their identity and their name.
An admiration to school means that it has entered the world of dreams and aspirations, where it can explore their potential for their future life.
I have five sisters, and none of them could go to school, and they would be surprised, two weeks before, when I was building the Canadian forever formalization, and I was in the relative part of the family, I couldn't remember the flash of some of my sisters.
And the reason was that I had never seen the names of my sisters written in any document.
That's why I value my daughter.
What my father couldn't give my sisters or their daughters, I thought I had to change it.
I used to appreciate the intelligence and the sacrifice of my daughter.
He encouraged me to sit with me when my friends came to me.
And the encourage to go with me to different meetings.
And all of these values, I've tried to plug them in their personality.
And this wasn't just for her, just for Malawi.
I've made all these good values in my school to girls and kids alike.
I used education for embracing.
He taught my daughters, taught students, to forget the lesson of obesity.
He taught students to forget the lesson of the call the Shaking.
dear brothers and sisters, we fought for more rights for women, and we struggle to have more and more space for women in society.
But we found a new phenomenon.
It was lethal for human rights, and in particular, for women's rights.
It was called Taliban.
That means a complete denial of women's participation in all political, economic and social activities.
Hundreds of schools were lost.
Girls were banned to go to school.
Women were forced to use veil, and they stopped going to markets.
The musicians were silently, the girls left and the singing singers.
They suffered millions but a few of them, and it was terrifying to have around those people who kill and drop when you talk about their rights.
It's really frightening.
At the age of 10 years, juggling was lifted up and lifted up on the right to education.
He wrote a newspaper for the BBC blog, she offered herself for the New York Times documentaries and talked about every platform he could.
And his voice was the most powerful voice.
It was spread as a clarie around the world.
And that was the reason why the Taliban couldn't tolerate their campaign and on October nine of 2012, they shot a burn in the head.
It was a classic day for my family and me.
The world became a big black hole.
While my daughter was devoted between life and death, he whispered my ear to my wife, "Should I blame me for what happened to my daughter to your daughter.
And he said, "Please don't blame you.
You define the right cause.
They put your life in play for the cause of truth, by the cause of peace, and by the cause of education, and your daughter was inspired by you and joined you.
They both were on the right path and God protecting it."
These few words meant a lot for me, and I didn't ask myself again.
When Malley was in the hospital and had severe power pains, because his facial nerve was cut out, I used to see a dark shadow that spread through the face of my wife.
But my daughter never complained about.
I used to say, "I'm fine with my smile and my entrepreneur in my face.
I'll get okay. Please don't worry.
It was a solace for us, and we have a comfort for us.
You want brothers and sisters, we've learned from her how to resist at the most difficult moments, and I'm pleased to share with you that despite being an icon for the rights of children and women, it's like any 16 year-old girl.
I cried when he didn't finish his task.
You fight with his siblings, and I'm very happy for that.
People ask me, "What about special in my tutor that has made so audacious to Mala-Mart so courageous, expressive and economically?
I tell you, you don't ask me what I did.
Ask me what I didn't do.
He didn't cut his wings and that's it.
Thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.
I was operated from the brain 18 years ago, and since that day, the science of the brain has become a personal passion.
I'm an engineer.
And I want to tell you that I recently joined the Monterey group, from Google, where I've had a division to my burden -- the visual division of Google X, but all the work I'm talking about today about the science of the brain, I made it before I joined Google or out of my work there.
Having said this, there is a stigma when you put a brain operation.
Are you still as smart or not?
If you can't be like this, you can be smart?
After neuroscience, I was missing a part of the brain, and I had to live with it.
It wasn't gray matter, but it was the dead part of the center that creates important hormones and neuroscience.
Immediately after the operation, I had to decide how far to take, from more than a dozen chemical powers every day, because if I didn't take anything, I would die in a few hours.
Every day, for the last 18 years, I've had to decide about combinations and metals of chemicals, and trying to get them to stay alive.
More than once I've been saved by a little bit.
But luckily, I have an experimental soul, so I decided that I would experiment to try to get the optimal doses because there really doesn't have a clear map that says it in detail.
I started testing with different mixes and I was surprised to see how small changes in the doses changed dramatically my automobile, my sense of who I was, my way to think, my behavior with others.
A particularly amazing case, for a few months, I tried the dose and typical chemicals for a man in front of a man, and I was amazed by seeing how my thoughts changed.
I was always farmer, I thought all the time in sex, and I thought it was the smartest person around the world, and   of course, many times in the past I've met several kinds of guys like this, or maybe some of the servering versions.
It turned out as an extreme.
But my great surprise was that I was not trying to be arrogant, actually.
In fact, I was trying to get a problem that I had at the front, and it just didn't happen like this.
So I couldn't handle it.
I changed my dose.
But I think that experience gave me a new appreciation about men and what they have to do -- since then I get better with men.
What I tried to do, when I adjust those hormones and neurotransmitters and so on, was to recover my intelligence after the disease and the operation, my creative thought, my flow of ideas.
I tend to think about almost always images, and that became my key reference point -- how do I get those mental images that I use to create prototypes, my ideas, if you want to test new ideas and recreate situations.
This kind of thoughts is not new.
Phones like Human, Destrus and HeForS see things like that.
They thought the images and mental ideas were the same thing.
Today there are people who are questioning this idea, and there are a lot of discussions about how the mind works. To me, it's simple: for most of us, mental images are fundamental for creative and investment thinking.
So, after several years, I managed to find the right point and I have lots of great mental magness, really violent, well sophisticated and good structures.
Now, I'm working on how to take these mental images, my mind to the computer screen.
Can you imagine what would happen if a movie director was able to use their imagination only to steer the world that has the front of the way?
Or if a musician could extract the music of his head?
There are incredible possibilities with this, as the way people creative people can get to share at the speed of light.
And the truth is, the only difficulty to do this is simply increase the resolution of our brain scanning systems.
Let me show you why I think we're pretty close to coming to this with two recent experiments made by two recent groups of neuroscience.
They both used MRI technology, image for functional magnetic resonance -- to represent the brain -- here you can see the brain scan done by Girlsh Gandhis and their Harvard colleagues.
The column on the left shows the scan of the brain of a person who looks at an image.
The media column shows the brain scan of that same individual as it imagined -- seeing that same image.
The column on the right was created by looking at the content of the central column of the left column -- you see that the difference is almost number.
This is repeated in many different individuals with many different images, always with a similar outcome.
The difference between seeing an image and imagining seeing that same image is almost number.
Now, let me share another experiment. This is the lab of Jack Galland in Berkeley, California.
They managed to convert brain waves into recognition fields.
Let's put it this way.
In this experiment, he showed people hundreds of hours of YouTube videos while they were being scanned their brains to create a big deal of brain reactions to video sequences.
Then I showed you a film with new images, new people, new animals, and while it was a new scanned.
The computer, using just the brain brain information I made it to show what it looks like the person was seeing.
On the right, you can see the democratization of the computer, and on the left, the video that I showed you.
This left us busy.
We're okay close to it.
We just need to improve resolution.
And now, remember, when you see an image, and when you imagine that same picture, you create in the brain the same map.
This was conducted with brain scanning systems available today, and their resolution was increased as a thousand times in the last few years.
We now need to increase the resolution about a thousand times more to get a deeper look.
How do we do it?
There are many techniques to do it.
One is to open the skull and bring electrodes in.
I don't offer that for that.
Many of them are proposing new project projection techniques -- even me. To count with the recent outcome of MRI -- first we should ask the next thing, this technology will be the end of the road?
conventional wisdom says that the only way to get more resolution is with larger images, but at this point, larger magnets only offer small improvements in resolution -- not increase for thousands of as we need.
I propose this idea: Instead of larger images, let's make better pictures.
We can create much more complex structures with slightly different arms, such as making a spirit.
And why does this matter?
In the last few years, a lot of effort in the MRI were to make really big images, right?
However, most recent advances in resolution of inventive and brilliant solutions in condition and decoding and the transmission and French radio frequencies in the MRI systems.
At its time, instead of a unified magnetic field, we use magnetic patterns attached to FM radio frequency.
So by combining magnetic patterns with the patterns of the processing of FM radio, we can increase massively the information that you can extract in one scanner.
In addition, we can then divide our growing knowledge on the structure of the brain and the memory to create the increase in the thousands we need.
By using the FMR, we should be able to measure not only the fluid fluid, but the ones of the hormones and neuroscientists that I've mentioned and perhaps even the direct neural activity -- this is sleep.
We will be able to fly our ideas into digital media.
Can you imagine if we could go over the language and communicate directly through thinking about it?
What would we be capable of?
And how do we learn how to deal with the truths of human thinking without filter?
You thought the Internet is a big thing.
These are big questions.
It would be irresponsible to use it as tool to amplify our thinking skills and communication.
Certainly, this same tool could lead to Alzheimer's cure and similar diseases.
We have a few options more than open this door.
Anyway, they choose a year -- it's five or 15 years?
It's hard to imagine that I'll take a lot more.
We have to learn how to give this step together.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you tonight about the closet, and not in a traditional sense, not just the gay closet.
I think we all have guns.
His weapon may be to tell some person for the first time that the love or tell someone who's pregnant, or tell someone who has cancer, or any other difficult conversation that you have caught in life.
All armed is a difficult conversation, and although our topics can vary tremendously. The experience of having lived and having come out of that closet is universal.
Day fear, and we don't like it, and it should happen.
A lot of years ago, I worked in the South Side Silk Camer, a restaurant in the city, and being there, I had to go through several phases of the intensity of the lucky military: I will not shake my armpits -- to quote the letters of Angel Da France as a language.
And I'm going to be penalty that by the home of my short screen, and I had a little bit offered my head a little bit, and I would ask myself a little bit of a child, "Hey, are you a guy or a girl?
And it would show an uncomfortable silence on the table.
I would take my jaw a little bit more, I would take my coffee with a radio leave.
The father would immediately choose the newspaper and the mother would launch a cold look at his son.
But I wouldn't say anything, and I would go inside.
And I came to the point that every time I went to a place where there was a child between three and ten years old, I was ready to fight.
And that's a terrible feeling.
So I promised that next time I would say something.
It would have that hard conversation.
So after a few weeks, it happened again.
Are you a guy or a girl?
A family silence -- but this time I was prepared and was about to go into the female affairs at the table --  I had Betty French quote.
The quotes of Gloria Senator.
Even a fragment of the "Vagina Monologues," I would show you.
And then I breathe around and I went down and I looked at the look and my backs, a four-and-a-half girl with a pink dress, looking at what is not a challenge for a feminist forest, just a girl with a question: "Are you a guy or a girl?
And then I breathe around again, I got out of climate near it, and I said, "Hey, I know this is a confusing thing.
I have the short hair like a boy, and I saw clothes, but I'm a girl, and you know, as you like to use a pink dress, and sometimes you like to use a comfortable pajamas.
Well, I'm more than a girl of a comfortable piece."
And that girl looked at me carefully, paying attention, and he said, "My favorite piece is a purple and it has a fish.
Can you give me a pandemic please?
And that was it. Just "Oh, OK. You're a girl.
What about the gift I did?
It was the easiest conversation of all that I've ever had.
And why? Because the girl in the pandemic and I, both of us, were honest one with the other.
As many of us, I've lived in some guns in my life, and yes, often, my walls used to be an archive.
But inside, in the dark, you can't know what color the walls are.
You just know how you feel like living in a closet.
That's how my weapon is not different to yours or yours or you.
I mean, I'm going to give you 100 reasons why to get out of my closet, it was harder than coming out of his own, but this is the thing: The hard is not relative.
The hard is hard.
Who can tell me that explaining to someone who has been declared in broken bank is harder than saying it's been engineered?
Who can tell me that this story that I tell you is harder than telling your five year-old son you're going to divide?
There's no more difficult thing, there's only the hard.
We need to stop classified what is difficult with respect to what difficult for another person to make us feel better or worse in relation to our closet, and we need to just feel empathy because we all live something hard.
At some point in our lives, we all live in guns, and they may make them feel security, or at least security than what the other side of the door offers the other side of the door.
But I'm here to tell you, no matter what your walls are, a weapon is not a place to live.
Thank you.  Imagine yourself 20 years ago.
I had a horse tail, a dress and high pull shoes.
It was not the military lesbian prepared to fight any four year-old child who would go into coffee.
I was frozen by fear, curled up in a corner of my dark closet, putting my big gay grain, and moving only a muscle is the most scary thing I've ever done.
My family, my friends, complete strangers that I've spent my entire life trying to not disappoint them, and now the world turned back to purpose.
I was burning the pages of a guide that we've all followed for so long, but if you don't toss that grain, you kill you.
One of my most memorable grains was in the wedding of my sister.
It was the first time that many of the invited people knew that it was gay, and when I did my honor of honor in my black dress and machines, I walked around the tables and finally came to one where the friends of my parents, people who knew me years ago.
And after talking a moment, one of the women said, "I love Nathan Lang!
And the gay seal battle had begun.
"And "an "Assan: Have you ever been in the Camp?
"Well, yeah, the truth is, we have friends in San Francisco.
"Well, we've never gone there, but we heard that it's fabulous."
"Oh, you know my Atlanta stimulation?
It's very good, and it's never talked about having a border."
"Association, what is your favorite TV program.
Is our favorite program William.
And you know who loves us? Jack Jack.
Jack is our favorite."
And then a woman, declined but waiting for desperately his support to make me know that I was on my side, he finally said, "Well, sometimes my husband uses pink ships."
And I had an opportunity at that time, as they have all the grain lands.
It could have been easy to indicate where they felt like.
It's not very hard to find them and realize the fact that they were strengthened.
And what else can you ask someone, but to struggle?
If you're going to be authentic with someone, you have to be prepared for how authentic you get.
It's just like the hard conversations follow without being my strong point.
Ask anybody I have come out.
But I'm getting better, and I follow what I like to call the three Prizes of the Pakistan Girl.
Now, please look at this through gay perspective, but you understand that what you mean coming out of any gun is essentially the same.
Number one: Be authentic.
Get the armor. Be yourself.
That girl in the coffee had no wonder but I was ready for the battle.
If you want someone to be genuine -- others must know that we also suffer.
Number two: Be straight -- just say it. Just take your parts.
If you know that they're gay, to tell it.
If you say to your parents that maybe they could be gay, they would keep the hope that that could change.
They don't give them a sense of false hope.
And number three, and more importantly,  leave the complex.
You communicate your truth.
You were never apologize for that.
And some of you can get out of safe wounds -- find out what they've done, but they never apologize for what they are.
And yes, maybe some of you will be disappointed, but that's something in them, not in you.
Those are the expectations of them about what you are, but not your own.
That's the story of them, but not you.
The only story that matters is what you want to write.
So the next time you find in an armed dark drawing a graduate, you must know that we've all been there before.
And you may feel very lonely, but they're not.
Thank you, Boll. Enjoy the flap.
Interestingly, what is that?
If we look at the story of how intelligence has been seen, a productive example has been the famous quote of Eduardo Disaster that "The question of if a machine can think about is as interesting as the question of a substance can navigate."
When Ed Die wrote this was made as a critic to the policy pioneers like Alan Turkey.
And so, a few years ago, I started a program to try to understand the fundamental physical mechanisms underlying intelligence.
Let's go back a step.
We first start with a mental experiment.
Imagine you're from an alien race that you don't know about the biology of the Earth or neuroscience or intelligence from the Earth, but they have incredible telescopes, and you can look at the Earth, and you have incredibly long lives, so you can see the Earth for millions, even billions of years.
And you see a very strange effect.
Of course, as terrorism, we know that the reason why we are trying to save ourselves.
We're trying to avoid an impact.
But if you are an alien race that doesn't know anything about this, that you don't have any concept on the intelligence of Earth, they would be forced to develop a physical theory that would explain how, even a moment in time, the asteroids that will demonstrate the surface of a planet virtually stop doing it.
And so I claim that this is the same question as to understand the physical nature of intelligence.
So in this program that I conducted several years ago, I analyzed a variety of issues through science, through various disciplines, that they pointed out, I think, to a single underlying mechanism of intelligence.
In cosmology -- for example, there has been a variety of evidence that our universe seems to be extremely adding for the development of intelligence, and in particular, for the development of universal states that maximize the diversity of possible future.
Finally, in robotic movement planning, there has been a variety of recent techniques that have tried to harness the skills of robots to maximize the future freedom of action in order to perform complex tasks.
And so by taking all these different issues and putting them together, I asked them, for a number of years, there is an underlying mechanism for the intelligence that we could extract from all these different tests?
Is there just an equation for intelligence?
And I think the answer is yes. What you're seeing is probably the closest equivalent to a E = my intention that I have seen.
So what you're seeing here is a claim that intelligence is a strength, F. that acts in order to maximize the future freedom of action.
It acts to maximize the future of action freedom, or maintain open choices, with a force T, with the diversity of possible future events, yes, even an impending future time -- a title.
In a few words, intelligence doesn't like to be attacked.
intelligence tries to maximize the future freedom of action and maintain open options.
And so, having on account this equation, it's natural to ask, "What can you do with this?
How predictable is it?
predicts the level of human intelligence?
predicts artificial intelligence.
So I'm going to show you now a video I think, showing some of the amazing applications of this simple equation.
Narrator: Recent research in cosmology have suggested that the universes that produce more destruction, or "attraction: during their life should have trend to more favorable conditions for the existence of intelligent beings like us.
But what if that temptation collective connection between entropy and intelligence is a deeper relationship.
What if intelligent behavior is not only correlated with the long-term entropy production, but actually emerges directly from it?
To figure out, we've developed a software engine called Education, designed to maximize the long-term entropy production in any system that is found inside.
Amazingly, Educationa could pass multiple animal intelligence testing, play human games, and even make money trading action, all of them without having to do that.
Here are some examples of Education in action.
Like a hunter of foot without searching, here we see Enricity balancing a pole by using a cart.
This behavior is remarkable in part because we never gave it a goal.
He simply decided to balance the position.
This ability of balance will have applications for human robotics and human assistance technologies.
This ability of tools of tools will have applications in intelligent manufacturing and agriculture.
In addition, just like some other animals can cooperate by pulling away from a rope at the same time to release food, here we see that Education can do a version of the model of that task.
This ability of cooperation has interesting consequences for economic planning and a variety of other fields.
Education is widely applicable to a variety of dominans.
For example, here we see it successfully playing a ping-pong game against itself, illustrate its potential for play.
So here we see Edinburgh organizing new connections in a social network where friends are constantly disconnected and kept successfully the net connected.
This system of network orchestra also has applications in health care, energy and intelligence.
Here we see Enrich organizing the routes of a ship ball, discovering successfully and using Panama Canal to expand the world from the Atlantic to the Pacific.
In the same way, entropy is widely applicable to problems in autonomous defense and logistics and transportation.
Finally, here we see Education spontaneously discover and run a bomb strategy, versus a service of a simulated series of action negotiation -- successfully increase the assets under their gas exponentially.
This ability of risk management will have broad applications in finance and safe.
Alex Wikipedia," what you've seen is that a variety of strangers of intelligent cognitive human behaviors such as use of tools, walking upright and social cooperation, all of them derived from one equation, which leads to a system to maximize their future freedom of action.
Now, here's a profound irony here.
We go back to the beginning of the robot, the Rubes work, the work "Random, there was always the concept that if we developed smart machines, there would be a cyber rebellion there.
The machines would come up against us.
One of the biggest consequences of this work is that maybe all these decades, we've had the whole concept of cyber rebellion to investment.
It's not that machines first become smart and then mechanical and trying to support the world.
It's all the opposite that the impulse of taking control of all future future is a more fundamental principle than the of intelligence, that general intelligence can actually come out directly from taking control, rather than being backwards.
Another important consequence is the pursuit of the target.
I often ask me, how do you look for targets to get away from this kind of frame?
My equivalent to that statement to go to the descendants to help them build artificial intelligence, or to help them understand human intelligence, is this: intelligence must be seen as a physical process that tries to maximize the future freedom of action and avoid restrictions in their own future.
Thank you very much.
We're at an inflection point in human history, something between the concrete of stars and losing the planet we call home."
Although, in the last few years, we've expanded a lot of our knowledge of how the Earth fit in the context of the universe.
NASA Kepler has discovered thousands of possible planets that orbit around other stars, which points that Earth is only one between the billions of planets in our galaxy.
Kepler is a space telescope that measures the luminous intensity of stars when planets go through them, and they block a little bit of that light that gets us.
The data collected by Kepler show the sizes of the planets as well as the distance of them and their stem star.
Instead, this helps us understand whether these planets are small, rocky planets like the Earth's planets in our solar system, and also the amount of light that they get from their sun.
At the same time, this gives you clues about whether these planets we find are habitable or not.
Unfortunately, as we are finding this fabric of potentially livable worlds, our own planet is falling under the weight of humanity.
The year 2014 was the most calculated record.
Glasses and sea ice who have been with us from the millennia now are disappearing in a matter of decades.
These environmental changes that we have caused global scale have really spread our ability to alter their course.
But I'm not a climate scientist, nor astronomer.
I study the speed of the planet influenced by stars, with hope to find places in the universe where to discover life beyond our planet.
You could tell you that I look for alien opportunities in the industrial sector.
Now, as someone very interested in the search search in the universe, I can tell you that the more I find the planets similar to Earth, more enjoy our own planet.
Each of these new worlds invites a comparison between the planet recently discovered and the planets we know better."
Let's take our neighbor -- Mars.
Mars is small and rich, and despite being a little further from the Sun, it can consider a potentially livable world showing this by a mission like Kepler Kepler.
In fact, it is possible that Mars has been habitable in the past, and partly that's why we study Mars.
Our Rover as the "Club track their surface in search for the origins of life as we know it.
The satellites that orbit it, like the one in the Maddish mission -- they take samples of the atmosphere -- and they try to understand how Mars has been able to lose their availability.
private companies now offer not only short space flights but also the tempting possibility of living on Mars.
But even though all these Mars images remind us to the desert of our planet, places that are linked in our imagination with cutting-edge ideas and policies, compared to Earth, Mars is a pretty terrible place to live.
We take the expansion of the destructive areas of our planet that still remain by colonizing, really extinguised places compared to Mars.
Even in the most dry and most elevated places of the Earth, air is fresh and short of oxygen that our rainforest forests to thousands of miles away.
I worry that this excitement by the colonization of Mars and other alien planets with a big and sad shadow, the implications and the belief of some that Mars will expect to save us from this influence of the only planet that we know is truly rapidly, the Earth.
And so I like the international exploration, I'm in deep disagreement with this idea.
There are many good reasons to go to Mars, but to say that Mars will be there to save humanity is how to imagine that the Titanic captain will tell us that the fear of truth is going to be later in the wild.   Thank you.
But the targets for interface exploration and land preservation are not contributed.
No, they are actually faces of the same coin, the goal of understanding, preserve and improve life in the future.
The extreme environments in our world look like extraterrestrial parallel.
They just find closer to home.
If we can understand how to create and maintain habitable spaces, in the hostile and inspiring areas of the land, maybe we can satisfy the need to preserve our environment and go beyond that.
I leave you with a mental experiment -- the Family paradox.
A lot of years ago, the physicist Enrico Fermi physicist said, having realized that our universe has existed for a long time, and we hope that there were a lot of planets in this universe, we should have found evidence of the existence of extraterrestrial life so far.
Well, where are they?
Well, a possible solution to the Fermi paradox is that when civilizations become advanced enough to consider to keep living between stars, they lose the notion of how important it is to protect the origin of planets that were driven by this development.
It's arrogant to think that only international colonization, we'll save us from ourselves, but planetary preservation and interface exploration can work together.
If we really believe in our ability to engage the hostile environments of Mars for human presence, then we should be able to overcome the task even easier to preserve the sustainability on Earth.
Thank you.
A few years ago, I took my own home.
And as I was in the front porch looking at my pockets, I realized I didn't have the keys.
In fact, I could see the window that they were on the dining table, where I had left them.
So quickly I tried to open up all the other doors and windows and all of them were fine.
I thought about calling a cloud, at least I had my cell phone, but at midnight, a cloud could take a lot of time to get there, and it made cold.
I couldn't go home from my friend from Jeff to spend night because I had an early flight to Europe in the next morning, and I was just aware of my passport.
It would be expensive, but I sure not more expensive than a cloud at the night, so I thought, despite the circumstances, it was a good stop.
I'm a profession of profession, and I know a little bit about how the brain works under stress.
It releases cortex that increases heart rhythm, modulate the levels of adrenaline and conducts thinking.
And when I came to the facial show in the airport, I realized I didn't have my passport.
Well, I had a long time to think about those eight hours without sleep.
And I started wondering, if there was something that I could do, systems that could put in its place, that they prevent bad things.
Or at least if bad things happen, that minimize the probability that it's a total catastrophe.
So I got to think about that, but until a month later, my thoughts didn't climb.
I was dinner with my colleague Danny Kalia, won from the Nobel Prize, and a little embarrassed I talked about he broke the window, and that I had forgotten my passport. And Danny shared with me that I had been practicing something called a propaganda report.
It's something that he had learned from psychologist Gary Kelly, who had written about this a few years before, known as a prime.
Everybody knows what the piece is.
Every time there's a disaster, a team of experts comes and tries to figure out what came wrong, right?
In the prime, as Danny explains it, you look forward and try to figure out all the things that could go wrong, next, try to figure out what can be done to prevent things to happen or to minimize damage.
So what I want to talk about with you is some things that we can do in the form of a prime.
Some of them are obvious, others are not so evident.
I'm going to start with the obvious ones.
In the house, to give a place for things that are easily lost.
This sounds common and it is, but there's a lot of science that supports this thesis -- based on how our spatial memory works.
There is a structure in the brain called hippocampus, which has evolved over thousands of years, to make a tracking of the location of important things, where the good is, where the fish are, which brings the fruit trees, where the friends and the enemy.
The hippocampus is the part of the brain that is grown in the London taxis.
It's the part of the brain that allows the squirrel to find their nuts.
And if you ask if someone really did the experiment, they cut the random sense of the squirrel and yet they could find their nuts.
They didn't use smell, but the hippocampus, that very evolved mechanism of the brain to find things.
But it's really good for things that don't move much, not so good for things that move a lot.
This is the reason for losing cars, reading glasses and passengers.
So at home you get a place for keys, a hook next to the door, maybe a decorative dish.
To your passport, a particular box in particular.
For your reading glasses, a particular message.
If you go through a place, and you're a desktop with it, you will always be there when you look at them.
What about trips?
They take the cell a picture of their credit cards, driver's license, passenger, send them for email themselves to be in the cloud.
If these things lose or steal them, this can facilitate subtle.
These are some of the most obvious things.
Remember, when you're under stress, the brain releases cortuinction.
The cortisol, the collaborator is toxic.
So part of the raw practice is to recognize that under stress, we're not going to be at the best time, and you have to put the systems on their site.
And there's perhaps no more stressful situation than when you face a medical decision.
And at some point, all of us will be in that situation, to have to make a very important decision about the future of our medical attention or a loved one, to help them with a decision.
And so I want to talk about that.
And I'll talk about a very particular medical condition.
But this is set up as a promise for all of these medical decisions, and in fact for the decision of financial decisions and social decisions, any kind of decision that you have to take from a rational assessment of the facts.
So suppose you go to the doctor and the doctor says, "I've received the result of the lab and the cholesterol is a little bit."
Everybody knows that the high cholesterol is associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular disease, attack to heart -- bridge.
So you're thinking that having the high cholesterol is not the best, then the doctor says, "I'd like to remember a drug that will help you reduce the cholesterol collapse, a station."
And perhaps you've heard of the statistics, and it knows that it's one of the most prescribed drugs in the world today. It's even likely to know people who take them.
So you think, "Yeah, I read the station."
But there's a question that you should do then, a statistics that you should ask for most physicians to do not want to talk about, and the pharmaceutical companies even less.
It's for NINJA, the number required to treat.
And what is this, the NASA?
It's the number of people who have to take a drug or make surgery in any medical procedure before they help a person.
And you have to think about what kind of statistical statistics is that?
The number should be one.
My doctor wouldn't remind me if I didn't help me.
But actually, medical practice doesn't work like this.
And it's not blame of the doctor, and if it's guilty of somebody, it's the scientists like me.
We haven't understood the underlying mechanisms.
But the estimates of Lithuiton that 90 percent of drugs work only 30 to 50 percent of the people.
So the number required to treat the most widely recognized season, what do you think it is?
How many people have to take it before they help a person?
300.
This is the research of the cynical researchers Jerry Group and Pamela Harria, confirmed independently by Blackberry.
I myself explore numbers.
300 people have to take the drug for a year before they avoid a single heart attack, which is brain or another adverse event.
Now maybe you think, "Well, one chance in 300 of my classroom.
Why not doctor." Doctor."
But then you have to ask for a more statistic statistics, and it is, "Tell me about the side effects of the side." Right?
For this particular drug, the side effects are produced by five percent of patients.
And those include terrible things: debated pain pain and articulate pain pain -- but now they think, "The five percent is not very likely to happen to me, still to take the medicine.
But a moment.
Remember that under stress you don't think of clearly.
So think about how you look at this over time, so you don't have to make the reasoning chain in the act.
300 people take the drug, right? A person has helped you, five percent of the 300 have side effects, that's 15 people.
You have 15 times more likely to be done by the drug that helps you be able to help you.
I don't say they should or not take the season.
I just say you should have this conversation with your doctor.
Medical ethics requires it, it's part of the informed consent principle.
We have access to this kind of information to start the conversation about whether you want to take the risks or not.
You may be thinking that I've launched this number in the air for the value of the crash, but actually this number needs to try to deal with it is quite typical.
For surgery that is done in the older men in the age of 50, extension of cancer prostate -- the number required to treat is 49.959.
So it's 49 surgeries for a person who has help.
And the side effects in that case are produced by 50 percent of the patients.
Those include the importance or eradication or in practical incident, recently large local, fecal incidence.
And if you get lucky, and it's one of that 50 percent of the effects just last one year or two.
So the idea of primary is to think before the questions that you can argue to drive the conversation forward.
You don't have to make all of this in the act.
And they also want to think about quality of life.
Because you have an option many times, you want a shorter life free of pain, or a longer life that could have a lot of pain to the end?
These are the things that they talk about and think about now, with their family and their loved ones.
They can change in the heat of the time, but at least you're trained in this kind of thinking.
Remember, our brain releases cortisol, and one of the things that happens at that moment is that a lot of systems.
There's an evolutionary reason for this.
Face with a predator -- you don't need the digestive system, or freedom or immune system, because if the body is spending metabolism in those things, it doesn't react with rapid. They could become the lunch of the lions -- so none of that matters.
Unfortunately, one of the things that is going through the window during those moments of stress is rational logical thinking, like Danny Kahn and their colleagues have shown.
So we have to train ourselves to think about the future to these kinds of situations.
I think the important thing here is to recognize that we are all defending.
We're all going to fail every time.
And the idea is to think about the future how they could be those fails, to put the systems in the place that will help you minimize the damage, or to prevent the bad things to happen in the first place.
By reinventing at the night of snow in Monterey, when I came back from my journey, my contractor was installed by a combination of combination along the door, with a key door in the same one, an easy way to remember it.
And I have to admit that I still have lots of letters that I haven't ordered -- and lots of mail messages that I haven't read.
So I'm not very organized -- but I see the organization as a gradual process, and I'm doing it.
Thank you very much.
Interpreter: Pian, "Patrong: It's my favorite musical symbol of me.
It means playing sustainable.
If you're touching a musical instrument and you see a party in the score, you need to play more sustainable.
Two paintings, even further.
Four period, extremely smooth.
This is my drawing of a piece of portrait: there you see no matter how many thousands and thousands of paint can be, never come to a complete silence.
That's my current definition of silence, a very dark sound.
I'd like to share a little bit about the story of the American American system, the ALS, plus a little bit of my own story.
The French sign language came over the 1800s, and over time, it mixed with local signs, and it developed the language that we know today as ALS.
So, it's about 200 years old.
I was born deaf, and they taught me to believe that sound wasn't a part of my life.
And I thought it was true.
But now I realize that it's not true at all.
Sound is a very important part of my life, they're really in my mind every day.
As a deaf person living in a world of sound, it's like I lived in a foreign country, following their rules, cosmologists, behaviors and rules without questioning them.
So how do you understand the sound of sound?
Well, I see how people behave and respond to sound.
People are like my authors and they amplify sound.
I learn and copy that behavior.
At the same time, I've learned that I can create sound, and I've seen how people respond to it.
So I've learned, for example.
"Don't cut the door."
"You don't do much noise in eating the bag of father friends."
"You don't build it, and when you're eating, it will make sure not to stop the covers on the plate."
I call this sound "tattoo!
Maybe I think of the sound label more than the average person does.
I am a little bit of a virgin of sound.
And I'm always waiting with nerves the sound, which is about to come next.
From there, this drawing.
TBP: Tenness.
TBP, to continue.
TBP: to announce it.
You can see that the player doesn't have notes on the lines.
That's because the lines already contain sound through subtle bureaucracy and broken.
In the deaf culture, movement is equivalent to sound.
This is the picture of "the "Panda in ALS.
A typical picture has five lines.
However, for me, I'm going to make my thumb with my thumb that doesn't feel natural.
That's why I just have four lines on the paper.
In 2008, I had the opportunity to travel to Berlin, Germany, for an artistic resistance there.
Before this time, I had worked as a painting.
During this summer, I visited museums and spaces of different galleries and as I went from one place to another, I realized that there was no visual art there.
At that time, the sound was the trend and it called me the attention.
There was no visual art, everything was auditorium.
Now the sound has entered my territory of art.
Is it going to tell me more about art?
I realized it doesn't have to be like that.
In fact, I know the sound.
I know it so well that it's not only experienced through ears.
I can feel it tactile or experience it, or even as an idea.
So I decided to reclaim the ownership of sound and integrate it into my artistic practice.
And everything that I had taught me in sound, I decided to leave it and learn it.
I started creating a new work of work.
And when I presented it to the artistic community, I was impressed with the amount of support and attention I got.
I realized sound is like money, power, control, social currency.
At the bottom of my mind, I always felt that sound was oblivious -- it was a little bit of an listener.
And sound is so powerful that it could well be subjected to me and my artistic job, or I could empower me.
I chose to be able to empower me.
There's a massive culture around the language.
And only because I don't use my literal voice to communicate, the eyes of society is as if I didn't have a voice at all.
So I have to work with people who can support me from the same and become my voice.
So I am able to be relevant in society today.
So in school, in work and institutions, I work with many different interviews from ALS.
And his voice becomes my voice and identity.
They help me be heard.
And their voices have value and weight.
Ironically, in order to borrow their voices, I am able to maintain a temporary form of value as well as taking a loan with a very high interest rate.
If I wasn't going to continue with this practice, I feel that I could slow up in the forgotten and not have any kind of social value.
So with the sound as my new artistic medium -- deep in the music world.
And I was amazed by seeing the similarities between music and ALS.
For example, a musical note cannot be captured and expressing it fully on paper.
And the same thing can tell you about a concept in ALS.
The two are very space and highly modified what it means that subtle changes can affect all of the meaning as much as the sounds of sound.
I'd like to share a metaphor from the piano, so they understand better how ALS works.
So, imagine a piano.
ALS is divided into many different grammar parameters.
If you assign a different paradigm for every finger while you touch the piano, like the facial expression, the body movement, the speed, the shape of your hand and so on as you touch the piano, English is a linear language, as if it would take only one key, at a time.
However, the ALS is more like a corporate, you need the 10 fingers in a similar way to express a clear concept or idea in ALS.
If only a keyboard would change the corporate, create a completely different meaning.
Same thing about music in terms of tone and shadows and volume.
In ALS, by using these different gravitational parameters can be expressed different ideas.
For example, the faith signal in that."
This is the wrong sign in that."
I'm looking at you.
Looking at it.
Oh, I got stuck.
U.K.
What are you looking at?
Oh, that right."
So I got to think, and if I look at the ALS through the lens of music?
If I had to create a sign and repeated it over and over again, it could become as a piece of visual music.
For example, this is the single day, the sun comes out and put it.
This is all day."
If you repeat it and reduce speed, it visually looks like a musical piece.
All day.
I feel that the same thing can tell you about all night.
"All night.
This is all night, in this drawing.
And this led me to think about three different kinds of nights, "No, "For the night --  "All night.
I feel the third has more music than the other two.
This represents how time is expressed in ALS and how the distance to the body can express changes in time.
For example, one hero. It's a hand, two heroes -- it's two hands, the present gets closer and in front of the body, the future is in front of the body, and the past is in the back.
So the first example is a long time ago.
Then, past: "Associated "A And the last, which is my favorite, with a very romantic and dramatic idea at the same time, "Once "Once I was once once.
"The common time is a musical term with a specific rate of four times for companies.
However, when I see the word time common: I think automatically at the same time."
Take a look at MD: Hand right, E, left.
We have the picture through the head and the chest.
(Music: MD: (Can fat -- Empire Commodity, E, fat fat." I'm going to show you a shape of the hand called "farm "grass."
Can you do it with me?
Everybody with high hands.
Now we're going to do it both in your head as the chest -- something like common time."
Yeah, very good.
That means "Look at the international system.
The international system, as a note, is a visual tool to help communicate in all cultures and sign languages around the world.
The second one I'd like to show you is this one. Please make it with me again.
And now this.
It means "the colony in ALS.
Now, the third one. Please tell me again.
And again.
It's "lighting in ALS.
We're going to do the three together.
"Love and collection and light."
Good job.
Look at how the three signs are very similar, everyone happens in your head and the chest. But they transmit meaning very different.
It's amazing to see how ALS is alive and present, like music.
However, today, we live in a very authoritarian world.
And only because the ALS doesn't have sound, automatically has no social value.
We have to start questioning what the social value defines and allowing the ALS to develop their own value, without sounds.
And this could be a step to make a society more inclusive.
And perhaps people understand that you don't have to be deaf to learn ALS. Not to hear to learn music.
The ALS is a rich test and I'd like you to have the same experience.
I'd like to invite you to open your ears, open your eyes, to participate in our culture and experience of our visual language.
And you never know, you can get to love with us.
Thank you.
Dennesses Kahrietz: Hey, that's me.
As a child, my parents told me, "You can tell me everything, but then you have to clean it.
Freedom involves responsibility.
But my imagination led me to all these wonderful places, where everything was possible.
So I grew up in an innocent bubble or a bubble of ignorance I should say, because adults lie to us to protect us from the horrible truth.
When I get older, I learned that adults also encourage and that they're not very good at cleaning the others.
The time country, now I'm an adult and a citizen and invention at the Harvard Connecticut in Hong Kong.
You don't have to wait a lot for my students to walk through the beach with lots of garbage tones.
So as good citizens, we clean up the beaches, and no, it's not drinking alcohol, and if it is, I didn't give it.
It's sad to say, but over 80 percent of the oceans contain plastic.
It's a special thing.
And in the last few decades, we've been coming out with these big ships and networks, collecting those bits of plastic to study them under the microscope, and we classify them and we collect this information on a map.
But it lasts an eternity and it's very expensive and it's also very risky to use those huge boat.
So along with my students, with ages of six to 15 years old, we dreamed to invent a better way.
We've transformed our tiny classroom in Hong Kong in a workshop.
We started building this message of a fascinating work so that the kids really can participate too.
And I'll tell you, the kids who manipulate electric tools are cool and safe.
Not exactly.
Let's go back to plastic.
We collect the plastic and we reduce it as we find it in the ocean, which is very small, because of its fragmentation.
We do that.
I leave it to the imagination of my students.
My job is to try to take the best ideas in every child and try to combine them in something that we expect it to work.
We decided that instead of collecting pieces of plastic, we just collect information.
Through the use of a robot, we take a picture of this plastic -- kids are excited about the robots.
We then created quickly what we call a prototype."
We're so quick in the creation of prototypes that we ended up before to lunch.
And we transform light bulbs and web cameras, and we assemble it in a floating robot that will move slowly by water, and by the plastic we have there, and this is the image captured by the robot.
We see the plastic pieces floating slowly through the sensor while the bureaucratic computer processing this image and measuring the size of every particle to get an approximate estimate of the amount of plastic in the water.
We document this step-by-step invention on a website called "International Institutes, with the hope that someone best even more.
The great thing in this project is that the students saw a local problem, and they were trying to solve it immediately.
I will investigate my local problem, but my students in Hong Kong are very difficult kids.
You see the news, they come up with the Internet, and they hit this image.
A child, maybe less than 10 years old, cleaning up an oil spill, just using the hands in Swedishing, the largest mangrove forest in the world in Bangladesh.
They were very surprised because this is the water that drinks -- it's the water in which they go away, the water where they fish, the place where they live.
You can also see that water is brown -- the neighborhood and oil are also commodities brown and when everything is mixed up, it's very hard to see what there is in the water.
But there is a simple technology called spectrum, which allows you to see what's in the water.
We built a first prototype of a spectrum that can deploy through all kinds of substance that produce different species, which can help identify what's in the water.
We outfitted this prototype with a sensor and sent it to Bangladesh.
The great thing about this project is that beyond solving a local problem, or analyzing a local problem, my students used their empathy and their sense of creativity to help shape other children.
And I was able to investigate a problem at the distance -- I was forced to do a second experiment, and I wanted to go a little bit further away, maybe to address a harder problem, and also closer to me.
I'm half Japanese and half French and perhaps remember, that in 2011, there was a devastating earthquake in Japan.
It was so violent that they trigger several giant waves called teams, and those teams destroyed several cities on the east coast of Japan.
More than 14,000 people died in a second.
It also gives the nuclear power plant in Fukushima, a nuclear central close to water.
And today, according to the reports an average of 300 tons.
Today, the whole Pacific Ocean has pollution traces for 1770.
If we go to the west coast, we can measure Muslim radiation everywhere.
But if you look at the map, it looks like most of the radiation disappeared from the Japanese coast, and most of the time, it looks safe -- it's blue.
Well, reality is a little bit more complicated than that.
I've come back to Fukushima, every year from the accident and research independently with other scientists, the land, the river, and this time we wanted to bring the children.
Of course we didn't take them, parents didn't allow it.
But every night we report to the control center here, you see the use of different masks.
It might seem like they didn't take the work seriously, but they did it because they are going to have to live with the activity all their life.
Along with them we discussed the data collected that day and talked about what we were going to do later, the strategies and the individual, etc.
And to do this, we created a rudimentary map of the region around the nuclear energy plant.
We created the power map, we introduced pieces to represent data in real time of radiation, and we rock water to simulate the rain.
So with this, we could notice that the radioactive dust was filtered from the top of the mountain to the river system and it was in the ocean.
It was an appropriate season.
But based on this we organize a civil expedition, the closest to nuclear central to date.
We went up to a mile of nuclear center, and with the help of fish fishermen -- we were collecting sediments from the sea milk with a service tracking as we invented and build.
Here we see a progress: we've gone from a local problem to a remote problem, a global problem.
And it's been very exciting to work on these different scales, also with open-source technologies and very simple code.
But at the same time, it's been increasingly frustrating because we've only been starting to measure the damage we've done.
We haven't even started trying to solve problems.
I wonder if we should give the leap and try to invent better ways of doing all these things.
So the classroom became a little bit small so that we found an industrial installation in Hong Kong and convert it into the largest space dedicated to social and environmental impact.
It's in the center of Hong Kong, and it's a place where we can work with wood, metal, chemistry, a little bit of biology, of optical -- basically, you can build almost everything there.
It's also a place where adults and children can play together.
It's a place where children can become really true with adults, and where adults can be children again.
Students: Apple application." Appearance."
Casable Harvard: We asked questions like, can we invent the future of mobility with renewable energy?
For example.
Or can we help the mobility of the advanced age population transforming their standard wheelchair chairs.
Plastic, oil and radiation are terrible, but the worst legacy we can leave our children are the lies.
We can't allow us to protect the kids from horrible truth because we need their imagination to invent solutions.
So scientific citizens, creator scientists, spaces, we need to prepare the next generation for the environment to worry about the environment and people, and so it can actually do something about it.
Thank you.
Two twin computers, two radically opposite design.
One is made from thousands of pieces of steel -- the other one of a single silk silk.
One is synthetic, the other organic.
One is impossible about the environment, the other thing creates it.
One is designed by nature, the other one.
Miguel angel said that when he looked at the broccoli in brutal -- he saw a figure that fights for being free.
The third was a single tool of Miguel angel.
But living beings are not climbed.
They grow up.
And in the smallest units of life, cells, we have all the information required by every cell to work and to replicate.
The tools also have consequences.
At least from the Industrial Revolution, the world of design has been dominated by rivers of manufacturing and production in mass.
The assembly lines have made a world made out of parts -- finding the imagination of designers and trained architects to think about their objects as extraordinary parts with different functions.
But you don't find master materials in nature.
Think about the human skin, for example.
Our facial skins are thin with diagnosed pores.
The skin skin is more thick with little pores.
You act primarily as a filter, the other mainly as a bar, and yet it's the same skin, there are no parts, no professionals.
It's a system that will gradually vary their functionality through the variation of electricity.
Here's a divided screen that represents my view of the divided world, the double personality of every designer and architect to work currently between the fish and the gene, between the machine and the organism, between the assembly and the growth, between Henry Ford and Charles Darwin.
These two visions of the world, my left hemisphere and the right, analytics and synthesis, is shown in the two screens after me.
My work, at its simplest level, tries to bring these two views of the world, moving away from the assembly and rising to growth.
You probably wonder, why now?
Why was it not possible about 10 or even five years?
We live in a very special moment in history, a rare moment, where they have four disciplines that offers access to tools that we had never had access to before.
And in the intersection of these four fields, my team and I create.
Please know the minds and the hands of my students.
We designed objects, products, structures and tools through scales -- of a lot of little scale, like this robotic arm with an about 24 meters of diameter with a very remote basis that some day not very far to print entire buildings, and graphic graphics made from genetically engineered microbial microbial microbes that shine in the dark.
So here we have reinvented the clever, an archetype of ancient Arab architecture, and it has created a screen where every openness is unique to model the shape of light and heat through it.
In our next project, we explored the possibility of creating a layer and a skirt -- this was for a fashion slide from Paris with Iraq van Hollywood. It's like a single piece made from a single piece, lying in the contexts -- flexible around the waist.
Together with 3D Stars printing collaborator, we print this layer and fallen 3D drug without the cells between cells, I'll show you more objects like that.
This helmet combine rigid and soft materials in the resolution of 20 minutes.
This is the resolution of a human hair.
It's also the resolution of a C.
designers have access to this high resolution of high resolution and synthetic instruments, allowing design products that are adopted not only the shape of our bodies, but also the physiological structure of our tissues, too.
We've also designed an acoustic chair, a chair at a time, comfortable and also it absorbs sound.
Professor Carter -- my collaborator -- we went back to nature to inspire us, and by designing this irregular surface, it becomes substantial.
We print this surface of 44 different properties that vary in rich, opportunity and color, running to the pressure points in the human body.
Their surface, as in nature, would vary their functionality not through addiction of another material or another assembly but it will be continually vary and delicious about material property.
But is it ideal nature?
There are no parts in nature?
I didn't believe in a religious Jewish home, but when I was young, my grandmother told me stories of the Hebrew Bible, and one of them was left and came to define a lot of what matters to me.
Like she relaxed, "In the third day of the creation, God sent to Earth to grow a fruit tree charged from fruit."
For that first fruit tree, there would be no difference between trunk, branches and leaves and fruit.
The whole tree was a fruit.
Instead, the land made growing trees with branches and cortex, collapses and flowers.
The earth created a world made from parts.
I often ask myself, "What would design be if objects were made from one piece?
Are we going to go back to a better state of creation?
So we found that the biblical material, the kind of material of the fruit tree with fruits, and we found it.
The second most abundant biologist on the planet is called the slave, and about 100 million tons are produced every year by organisms like shrimp, contacts, skeletons and butterfly.
We think that if we could tune their properties, we could generate multicultural structures in a single piece.
So that's what we did.
We call it a legal marine.  We were asking a lot of shrimp scans, and we moved them and we made taken passenger.
Variant concentrations have been able to achieve a wide range of property, from dark, hard and opaque, to light, soft and transparent.
To print the large-scale structures, it was built a system with multiple board of controlled strategic strategic.
The robot could vary the properties of material on the march and create these structures made from a single material -- three meters long, 100 percent recycled.
When the pieces are ready, they let them dry to find a natural way to contact with air.
So why do we keep designing with plastic?
The air bubbles that were a byproduct of the printing process were used to contain photographers that came out for the first time on planet three billion years ago, as we heard yesterday.
Together with our collaborators at Harvard and MIT, we included bacteria designed to rapidly capture carbon from the atmosphere and turn it into sugar.
For the first time, we've been able to generate structures that make their transition without a mesh -- and if they expand even more, to windows.
A fruit tree loaded out of fruit.
Working with an ancient material, one of the first forms of life on the planet, with abundant water, and with a little bit of synthetic biology, we've transformed a structure made out of shrimp scans in an architecture that behaves like a tree.
And here's the best part: for objects designed to biomechanically, put them in the sea, feed the marine life, and put them on the ground, help grow a tree.
The fit for our next exploration using the same design principles was the solar system.
We look for the possibility of creating clothes to keep life for the transparent travel.
To do that, we need to dominate bacteria and control its flow.
Just like the periodic table, we made our own table of items, new forms of life created politically manufactured and adding in biological ways.
I like to think of synthetic biology like liquid alchemist, only instead of transmitting precious metals -- new biological functions inside very small channels.
This field is called a microphone.
We printed our own 3D channels to control the flow of these liquid bacterial crops.
In our first piece of clothing, two microbial minds.
The first one is collaborator.
It lives in our oceans and the freshwater stages.
And the second one, E. College, the bacteria that inhabit the human intestine.
One converts light in sugar, the other consumer consumption and produces useful biofuels.
But these two microorganisms, they don't interact in nature.
In fact, they never met.
They are here, designed for the first time, to have a relationship in a piece of clothing.
Think about it as evolution, not by natural selection, but evolution for design.
In order to contain these relationships, we've created a single channel that resembles the digital tract that will help them flow these bacteria and to alter their function function.
So we started to grow those channels in the human body, vary the properties of material according to the desired function.
If we wanted more photosynthesis, we designed more transparent channels.
This popular system, when it comes from one end to another, is about 60 meters.
This is half the length of a football field, and 10 times more than our intentional intestine.
And here is, as a TED school, our first popular photographer, brilliant liquid channels with life inside the clothing.
Thank you.
Mary Shell said, "We are creative creatures, only half is done."
What if design would provide the other half.
What if we could create structures that increase life living?
What if we could create personal microbes that would hide our skin, they would repair the damaged tissue and hold our bodies out?
Think about this as a way to edit biology.
I call this material ecology.
For that, you always have to go back to nature.
For now, you know that a 3D printer printed material in layers.
You also know that nature doesn't do this.
It grows up.
This worm of worm, for example, creates a highly sophisticated architecture, a home within which it measures.
The non-to-one manufacturing is about this level of sophistication.
It does it through combination not about two materials but two proteins in different concentrations in different concentrations in different events.
One act as a structure, the other one is glue or matrix, using those fibers each other.
And this happens through scales.
The silk worm is actually presented in the environment, creates a tension structure, and then it starts a climate of compression.
tension and understanding, the two forces of life, they manifest in a single material.
In order to better understand how this complex process, we pasted a small magnet to the head of a silk worm to the skin.
We put it inside a box with magnetic sensors, and that allowed us to create this cloud of points in three dimensions and visualize the complex architecture of the silk worm card.
However, when you put the silk worm on a flat patch -- not in a box, we realized that I hid a flat circle and still motivate a signal.
So we started designing different environments, different analogies, and we've discovered that the way, compassion, the structure of the circle is transmitted directly by the environment.
They often take silk worms up to death within their collapses, their silk gets rid and used in the textile industry.
We saw that designing these plants, we can shape the raw silk without boiling a single computer.
They get massively motivated and we could create these things.
So we climb this process up to the architectural scale.
We had a hydrogen robot making silk plants, and we put ourselves on our site.
We knew that silk worms migrated towards more dark and cold areas so we used a solar route diagram to reveal the distribution of light and heat in our structure.
So we created holes or openings, to block the rays of light and heat -- distributing silk worms on structure.
We were prepared to get the origins.
We asked 6,000 silk worms to an online silk farm.
And after feeding four weeks, they were prepared to half with us.
We put them carefully on the lower edge of the scaffolding edge, and as they handle, they were coming out, they were getting eggs and life starts again, like us, but much, much more short.
Buckminster Fuller said that tension is the great integrity and I was right.
The billion silk silk on the hill ridiculeal silk, they give all this pavilion their integrity.
And in a little over two or three weeks, 6,000 silk worms are 6,000 miles.
In a curious symmetry -- this is also the length of the silk route.
The polishers, after the electron, produce 1.5 million eggs.
This could be used for 250 additional pavilion in the future.
So here are the two visions of the world.
A silk ice through a robotic arm, the other full full collapse.
If the last frontier of design is to bring life to products and buildings around us, to form an ecology of two materials, designers have to join these two visions of the world.
Which brings us back, of course, at the beginning.
Here's a new design era, a new era of creation, which brings us from an inspired design in nature to a nature inspired in design, which demands from us, for the first time, that we make a burden of nature.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Raise your hand if you've ever asked them, "What do you want to be a most?
If you had to remember what age they had when they first asked them about this?
You can show it with the fingers.
Three. Five. Five. Five. Five.
Now, raise your hand if the question is, "What do you want to be a most?
It's caused some kind of anxiety.
Any anxiety.
I'm somebody who could never answer the question, "What do you want to be a most?
The problem wasn't that I didn't have any interest, but I had too much.
In school I liked English, the peanuts and the art and developed websites, and he would play the guitar.
Maybe you've heard about us.
And in general, I like to try and persist anyway, to have dedicated a lot of time and energy and sometimes money in this field.
But over time this sense of abuse, this feeling of this, this is no longer a challenge, it comes to me.
And I have to leave it.
But then I'm interested in another thing, something completely different, and I put it up in it, and I'm going to let me absorb and feel "Yeah! I've found my mind: and then again, this point where I start to get bored.
And finally, I want to leave it.
But then I'd like to discover something new and different, and I'd like to go into that.
This pattern caused me a lot of anxiety, for two reasons.
The first was because I wasn't sure how I was going to convert all this into a career.
I thought I had to choose one thing, to deny all of my other passions, and keep me to get bored.
Another reason why I got so much anxiety was a little bit more personal.
I was worried that there would be something wrong about this, and something bad in me not defined by anything.
I worried about being afraid to compromise or to be dispersed, or to self-seece or to my own success.
If you can relate my story and these feelings, I would like to ask you something I would like to have planted to you.
Ask themselves, where they learned to assign the meaning of evil or abnormal to do things.
I'll tell you where they learned it, they learned from culture.
We are asked first, "What do you want to be a big?
We have about five years old.
And the truth is, no one cares about what you respond to that age.
You can consider a naive question to produce cute answers in children like, "Be a astronauts: or be a dancer: or "I want to be a piece."
They look at the Harlem description here.
This question is done over and over again as we grow up in different ways, poor, -- to high school students that are going to pick up in college.
And at some point, "What do you want to be a big?
It happens to be the cute exercise of before what drives us the dream.
Why?
If this issue inspired children to dream with what they might be, it doesn't inspire dreaming about everything they could be.
In fact, it does just the opposite, because when someone asks you what you want to be, you can't answer with 20 different things, even though adults well intentional people might be randomized and say, "Oh, what cute, but you can't be a personal artist and psychologist.
You have to choose.
This is Dr. Bob Chiles  and he's an art of rape and psychopath.
And this Amy Nano, magazine editor turned into illustration, entrepreneur and teacher and creative director.
But most children don't hear about people like this.
All you hear is, they're going to have to choose.
But it's more than that.
The notion of life focused on our culture.
It's this idea of fate, or the real voice, the idea that each of us has something to spend during your time on this land, and you have to figure out what that thing and dedicate your life to it.
But if you're someone who's not connected in this way?
What if there are many different issues that wake up their curiosity and many different things that want to do?
There's no place for someone like one in that frame.
And so you can feel alone.
You can feel that it doesn't have a goal.
And feel like there's something wrong with one.
There's nothing wrong in you.
You're a multiplex.
A multiple is someone with a lot of interest and creative activities.
It's a fire for that.
It could help if you divide in three parts: multiple and potential and day.
You can also use other terms that connect the same idea, as a school, renewable.
Over the time of the Renaissance, the ideal was who was fine in multiple disciplines.
Barbara She is referred to us as a scientists."
They use any term you like or invent your own.
It seems to me as a species of adapting to a community, we can't agree with one identity.
It's easy to see multi-fire as a limitation or a partnership that you have to belong.
But what I've learned talking to people and writing about these ideas on my website, is that there are huge strengths in being this way.
Here are three multiple superpowers here.
One, the synthesis of ideas.
I mean, the combination of two or more fields and creating something new in the intersection.
Shanghai Chanana and Rachel Bina expressed their own shared interests in cartography, data visualization -- travel, mathematics and design, at the founding Muslim.
Memorial is a company that creates geographical intrigues.
Shanghai and Rachel came up with this idea of the unique idea of skills and experiences.
Innovation happens in intersections.
There are new ideas.
And the multiplexent, with all their background, can access a lot of these points of interest.
The second multiple superpower is fast learning.
When the crowds are interested in something, we go to it.
We look at everything we can have in our hands.
We're used to being principles, because we've been a lot of times in the past, and this means that we have less afraid of testing new things and coming out of our comfort areas.
A lot of skills are transparent to other disciplines, and we bring everything that we've learned to every new area that we would do, so we rarely start from zero.
Norman Dunney is a full-time journey and independent writing.
As a pianist child perfect an incredible capacity to develop muscle memory.
Now, she's the fastest known manufacturing.
Before becoming a writer, Norway was financial planners.
He had to learn the most final sales mechanics when he started their practices, and this ability helps to write compelling launches for publishers for publishers to write the editors.
It rarely is a waste of time to dedicate what you do, even if at the end of the end.
It's possible to apply that knowledge in a completely different field, in a way that you couldn't have anticipated.
The third multiple superpower is adaptability. That is, the ability to transform whatever you need in a given situation.
Abe Christon is sometimes director of videos, other people, web designer -- sometimes consumer from Kickstarter, sometimes teachers, and, sometimes, James Bond.
It's valuable because it does a good job.
He's even more valuable because it can take different roles -- depending on the needs of their clients.
The Fast Company defined adaptability as the most important ability for development, to thrive in the 21st century.
The economic world changes so quickly and unpredictable that they are the individuals and organizations that can path to satisfy the needs of the market, the ones that will actually thrive.
Security of ideas, quick learning and adaptability -- three skills where the crowds are very hardware, and three skills that could be lost if they're imprisoned to reduce their goals.
As a society, we have a great interest to foster the multiplexent ones to be themselves.
We have complex problems, multi-dimensional problems right now, and we need no conventional creative thinkers to deal with them.
Let's say they are, in your heart, specialists.
They came out of the belly knowing that they wanted to be pediatric neurosurgeon.
Don't worry, there's nothing wrong in you either.
In fact, some of the best teams are made from a specialists and a multiple specialized multiplex.
The specialists can dive in deep and put in practice ideas, and the multi-frightening offers an amplitude of knowledge to the project.
It's a beautiful relationship.
But we should all design lives and careers that are abandoned with how we are connected.
And unfortunately, to multi-folds in large parts are encouraged to simply be more like their personalized partners.
And once I said this, if there is one thing you take from this talk, I hope it's this: reconcile with the inner wire, whatever it is.
If you're a heart specialist, then, especially for all media.
That's where you will give you the best one.
But for the multiplexent in the room, including those who just realized being one of them in the last 12 minutes,  I tell them, reconcile with your many passions.
They follow your curiosity for those rabbit markets.
They explore the intersection.
Openly our inner wiring leads us to a more authentic and happy life.
And perhaps most importantly, multiplexent, the world needs us."
Thank you.
In 1991, a woman named Augusta took it to a psychiatric in France.
August discovered and couldn't remember even the most basic details in his life.
His doctor was called Ales.
Albanians didn't know how to help August, but I would come up with her until unfortunately passed in 1908.
After his death, Alaska made a supply and they found strange plates and hairs in the August brain, a guy who had never seen before.
The most surprising.
If Aurora had been alive today, we could not give her more aid than the people who were 14 years ago.
Ales was Dr. Alabama Alzheimer's Dr.
And August Deptheise, the first patient to get a diagnosis that we now call Alzheimer's disease.
Since 1904, medicine has moved a lot.
antibiotics have been discovered and vaccines to protect us from infection, many treatments for cancer, anthropologists for HIV, state for catastrophes and so much more.
But it has been progress in the treatment of Alzheimer's treatment.
I'm part of a team of scientists who work to find a cure for Alzheimer's for more than a decade.
So I think about this all the time.
The Alzheimer's now affects 40 million around the world.
But in 2050, affect 150 million people, by the way, will include many of you.
If you wait to live until 85 or more, the possibility of Alzheimer's going to be almost one in two.
In other words, there is the probability that they spend their golden years with Alzheimer's or helping to take care of a friend or want to be loved with Alzheimer's.
Already in America, Alzheimer's care costs 200 billion dollars every year.
One of five dollars of medical assistance is spent in the disease.
Today it's the most expensive disease, and its cost is a rise of five times in 2050, as it prevents the generation of the bomb bomb.
They may surprise you, but Alzheimer's one of the greatest medical and social challenges of our generation.
But it's been relatively done to combat it.
Today, one of the top 10 sources of death from all over the world, Alzheimer's the only one you can't prevent it, cure or even slow up its development.
We understand less than Alzheimer's than other diseases because we've invested less time and money in research of the same.
The U.S. government spends 10 times more every year in cancer research than in Alzheimer's despite the fact that it costs us more Alzheimer's and causes a similar number of deaths like cancer.
The lack of resources is due to a more fundamental cause, the lack of consciousness.
Because this is what few people know, but everybody should be -- Alzheimer's a disease, and we can cure it.
For most of the last 14 years, all of us, even scientists, confused Alzheimer's with aging.
We think it will become a sense in a normal and inevitable part of aging.
But there is only one picture of a healthy aging brain in comparison with the compassion of an Alzheimer's patient to see the actual physical damage caused by this disease.
In addition to designing a severe loss of memory and mental skills, the damage to the brain caused by Alzheimer's reduced life expectancy, and it's always deadly.
Remember, Dr. Alzheimer's found planes and strangers in the August brain a century ago.
For almost a century, we didn't know a lot about this.
Today we know that they're made of protein molecules.
You can think of a protein molecule like a piece of paper that folds as an origami.
There are places on paper that are personalizing.
And when it folds well, these sticky dots end up inside the inside.
But sometimes things come wrong, and some sticky dots are left in the outside.
This makes the protein molecules come up with each other, forming groups that can form big plates and hairs.
That's what we see in the patient's brain with Alzheimer's brain.
We've spent the last 10 years at Cambridge University trying to understand how this dysfunction works.
There are a lot of steps, and the identification of what step block is complex, like deflecting a bomb.
cut, a cable could do anything.
Currently it can make the bomb explode.
You have to find the right step that blocked it, and then create a drug that does it.
Until recently, most of them have reduced the wires and waiting for the best.
But now there is a diverse group of people, doctors, biologists, generations, chemistry, physicists, engineers and math.
And together, we've managed to identify a critical step in the process. Now it's testing a new kind of drugs that blocked specifically this step to stop disease.
I'll show you some of our latest results.
No one outside our lab has seen it yet.
So let's see some videos of what happened when we tested these drugs in worms.
These are the healthy worms and you can see that they move with normal.
These worms -- on the other hand, they have protein molecules that stand up within them, as in humans with Alzheimer's disease.
And you can see that they're clearly sick.
But by giving our new drugs to these worms at an early stage, then we see that they heal and live a normal life.
This is just a positive initial outcome, but the research as this shows that Alzheimer's is a disease that we can understand and cure.
After 14 years of expected, there is real hope of what can be achieved in the next 10 or 20 years.
But to grow that hope, to beat Alzheimer's disease, we need help.
It's not about scientists like me, it's about you.
We must be aware that Alzheimer's is a disease, and that if we try it, we can beat it.
In the case of other disease, patients and their families have increased more research and exercise pressure on governments, pharmaceutical industry, about scientists and legislation.
That was essential to move into HIV treatment in the late 1980s.
Today we see that same unit to beat cancer.
But Alzheimer's patients often can't talk for themselves.
And their families, the hidden victims, caregivers of their loved ones and night, are often too lowered to go out and advocate for change.
So, it really depends on you.
Alzheimer's not in most cases a genetic disease.
Everybody with a brain runs the risk.
Today, there are 40 million patients like Augusta, who can't create the change they need for themselves.
They help talking for them, and they help demand a cure.
Thank you.
I published this article at the New York Times column in January of this year.
To love someone, do this.
The article is about a psychological study, designed to create romantic love in the lab, and from my own experience by testing it a night last summer.
So the procedure is pretty simple: two strangers were turned to make 36 more and more personal questions and then both of them look at the eyes without speaking for four minutes.
Here's a couple of questions.
Number 12: If you could wake tomorrow with a quality or skill, what would it be?"
Number 28, when was the last time you cry to another person?
And just alone?
As you move forward, these are increasingly personal.
Number 30 -- this really -- I just like you to tell your partner what thank you or she -- I know very honest this time, and I gave things that you wouldn't say to someone you've ever met.
When I stumbled with this study a few years ago, a detail really called me attention, the promise that two of the participants had married six months after and invited all of the laboratory to the ceremony.
So, it was skeptical about this process of making romantic love, but of course, I was also intrigued as well.
And when I had the occasion of testing this study, with someone I knew not particularly very well, I didn't expect to fall to me.
We fell in love with us, and --  -- and I thought it was a good story, so I sent her to the column love Mortana Model a few months later.
That was published in January, and now it's already August -- so I guess some of you probably ask yourself, follow together yet.
And the reason I think you think about this is because I've been asked this question again and again in the last seven months.
And this question is just about what I want to talk about today.
But let's go back to the issue.
A week before the article was published, he was very nervous.
I had been working on a romantic book in the last few years, so I had used to write about my experience in romantic love in my blog.
But a blog entrance can come to a few hundred views as a lot, and those were usually just from my Facebook friends and imagine that my article in the New York Times will probably reach a few thousand views.
And that led a good charge of attention in relatively new relationship.
But as he said, I had no idea.
The article was posted on line a Friday night, and the Saturday, this happened in my blog traffic.
And the Sunday -- I had already called me the American Solar and the Gulf Mount American.
In a month, the article received more than eight million visit, and I was, by saying something, little prepared for this kind of attention.
One thing is to foster trust by writing with simplicity about your own loving experiences, but another thing is to discover that the loving life of one has been international news --  -- and that people around the world are really interested in the state of your new relationship.
And when people called or writing, what they did every day for weeks, they always asked the same question: still follow together?
In fact, when I was preparing this talk, I made a quick search for the mailbox of my email with the phrase, "So do you go together?
And several messages appeared immediately.
They were from students and journalists and short-term and strangers like this.
I was interviewed in the radio and asked it.
Even I gave a talk, and a woman scream up to the stage, "Hey Mandela "Where is your nose?
And immediately I got red.
I understand that this is part of the deal.
If you write about your relationship in an international journal, you should expect people to feel comfortable asking about it.
But I wasn't prepared for the answer to the answer.
The 36 questions seemed to have covered life.
In fact, the New York Times published a regular article for San Valentine, who included the experiences of readers by testing study in them with different degrees of success.
So, my first impulse of all this attention was to be very reserved with my own relationship.
I said not to every request that we both do a public emergence together.
I did television interviews, and you refuse the pictures of pictures of us.
I think I was afraid to become the invisible icons of the entrepreneur process, a range for which I didn't feel at the absolute calories.
And I understand that people didn't want to know only if the study worked, they wanted to know whether it really worked, or whether it was able to produce perfectly lovely, not only an adventure, but love real, lovely love.
But this was a question I didn't feel able to answer me.
My relationship was just a few months ago, and I felt, above all, that people would ask the wrong question.
How do we know if we would go together or not, and then to say that?
If the answer was not, would the experience do these 36 less interesting questions.
Dr. Arthur Aron wrote first about these questions in this same study in 1997, and there, the goal of the researcher was not producing romantic love.
Instead, I was looking at to promote interpersonal access between university students, using what they were called a sustainable personalized personalization, progressive and recovery.
Sounds romantic sound, right?
But the study did work.
The participants felt closer after doing that, several subsequent studies also used American American protocol as a quick way to create trust and interaction between strangers.
They've used it between the members of police and community, and they've used it between people of opposite political ideology.
The original version of history, which I tried last summer, who combine personal questions with four minutes of visual contact, was quoted in this article but unfortunately never published.
A few months ago, I was giving a talk on a little liberal arts university, and then a student came up to me, and he said to me, "I tried the study and he didn't work.
He seemed declined by it.
And I said, "Do you mean you fell love with the person who did it?
Well, he made a break.
I think she just wants us to be friends.
And I said, "But became better friends?
Did you feel that they got to know better about testing the study better?
The sand.
So it worked, I said.
However, I don't think that was the answer that he looked for.
In fact, I don't think it's the answer that none of you are looking for when it's about love.
I stumbled with the study for the first time when I was 29, and I was doing a really difficult one.
I had had that relationship since I had 20, which was pretty much my entire life, and he was my first real love, and I had no idea how or if I could live without him.
So I moved into science.
I investigate everything I could find about the science of romantic love, and I expected that that could somehow be vaccinated by the heart.
I don't know if I realized this at the time, I thought I only did research for the book that he wrote but in retrospect, it looks like really obvious.
I thought if I was laughing with the knowledge of romantic love, I would never have to feel as bad and just as I felt then.
And all of this knowledge has been useful in one way.
I'm more patient with love. I'm more relaxed.
I have more confidence to demand what I look for.
But I can also see more clearly, and I can realize that what I look for is sometimes more than I can really get to me.
What I look for from love is a guarantee -- not just being loved today and being loved tomorrow, but to keep being comfortable for the person I love.
It may be that this is the guarantee that people asked when they wanted to know if we were still together.
The story that the media told about 36 questions is that there can be a shortcut to love.
There can be a way to somehow mitigate some of the implicit risk, and this is a very attractive story, because we love us to feel wonderful, but it's also terrifying.
But I think when it's about love, we're very willing to accept the short version of history.
The story of the story that I ask you, still follow together?
And its content with an answer from yes or not.
So more than a question, I would propose we ask questions harder questions, questions like: How do you decide who deserves your love and who doesn't?
How do you stay in love when things are compared to, and how do you know when to cut and disappear?
How do you live with uncertainty that inevitably leads a relationship, or even more, how do you live with the doubt of your mate?
I don't necessarily know the answers to these questions, but I think it's a good start to have a more reflective conversation about what it means to love someone.
So, if you want the short version of my relationship -- it's this one, a year ago, and I applied a study designed to create romantic love, we fall in, we still follow together, and I'm very happy.
But love is not the same thing to stay in love.
Love is the easy part.
So at the end of my article wrote, love didn't happen.
We stay in love because we take the choice to be.
And I was feeling a little bit about reading it now, not because it's not true, but because at the time, I had not considered everything that was supposed to put that choice.
I don't consider how many times we would have both that decision, and how long I will have to continue to make that choice without knowing before he always chose me or not.
I want you to be enough to have done and answer 36 questions, have chosen to love someone so generous, nice and fun and expressed that choice in the largest newspaper in the United States.
But what I've done, instead, is to convert my relationship into the kind of myth that I don't think really.
And what I look for, and what maybe spending my life is that that myth is true.
I want the happy end in the title of my paper, which is, in the way, the only part of the article that I didn't actually write.
But what I have in change is the opportunity to love someone, and the hope that he will also love me, and it's frightening, but that's the deal with love.
Thank you.
I was raised by a little legacy in full mountains, and in a way, I came as a forest gentleman.
in New York City, a time ago.  Something that really affected me but more details later.
I'll start with when I was eight years old.
I took a wooden box, and I found a billion of a dollar, a pen and a fork in it somewhere in Colorado.
And I thought that some strange humans or some aliens would find this box about 500 years later and learn how our species exchange ideas, for example, how we eat the spaces.
I had no idea.
Anyway, it has because here I am, 30 years later, and I'm still making boxes.
At a given time, I was in Hawaii -- I like to go from excuse and support and all those weird things -- and I was making a collection for my mother.
And I took a dictionary and I grabbed all the pages and I made a kind of cardially classical cells to the Agnes Martin style -- the angel covered them and a bee was attacked.
Well, my mother is afraid of bees and it's allergic to them, so I added more resistance in the canvas, thinking I could hide it.
Instead, the opposite happened: somehow it seemed that it was increased in size, as if you were to look at the text with a magnifying game.
So I did that? I built more boxes.
This time, I started adding electronic elements, frogs -- strange bottles that I was going to find out of the street, everything I could find, because I was looking for things all my life, trying to relate them and tell stories about these objects.
So I got to draw around the objects, and I realized that God can draw in space.
I can flow transparent, draw the same that is done around a card at the scene of crime.
And I took the objects and I created my own special special special speech.
First, bombers -- you can make an idea.
Then I did some strange insects and strangers.
It was very fun to draw on the resident layers.
And it was great, because I started riding exhibitions and those things, and I was making some money, to bring my girlfriend to dinner, for example, go to Six.
It was great, man.
At some point I was interested in the human form, residential scale sculptures with drawings of human beings within layers.
It was great, except for one thing: I died.
I didn't know what to do, because the resistance was going to kill me.
And I went to bed every night thinking about it.
So I tried to use glass.
I started drawing on the glass layers, similar to the drawing in a window, then in another window and another window, and I had all these windows together that formed a three-dimensional composition.
And this really worked, and so I could stop using the room.
So I did this for years, and my work collapsed with something very big -- that I call triangulation."
For the critical I was inspired by a great inspiration on "The Barrier of Deliberators of Heroin Boston who is a painting in the Museum of Prince in Spain.
Do you know that?
Well, it's a fantastic picture.
They say it's a little bit ahead of your time.
Well, the criticize." I'll explain this piece.
It weighs 11,000 pounds.
Five feet long.
It has double face, so it's 10 meters of composition.
It's a little bit weird.
Well, that's the blood source.
On the left is Jesus and the languages.
There's a cave where all these creatures with animal heads travel between two worlds.
They go from the world of representation, this analog mesh infrared where they hide.
Here's where the creatures with the heads of animals are headed to the face of the face, ready to commit mass in the ocean.
The ocean is comprised from thousands of elements.
This is a bird god attached to a corner.
Billy Graham is in the sea. The Hornia -- the store platform of the standard -- Waller, the Osama Bin Laden. There are all kinds of weird things that can find if they look very well in the ocean.
Anyway, also a kind of woman.
It's coming out of the ocean, and I spit oil in a hand while the other hand is coming out clouds.
Their hands are like balances, and it looks like a mythological self that keeps Earth and cosmos in balance.
So it's an aspect of the critic."
It's a bit of a narrative.
That's the hand that I spit in.
And then when you go on the other side, you have a train, like a piece of bird, and I find clouds of this show.
It also has a $20 tail of a snake line that unites the criticism."
Anyway, their tail is finding the fire as a volcano comes.
I don't know why that happened.
Things that happen, you know.
His tail ends up in a block of Clap that made out of terrorist cards in 1986.
Have you seen them?
They were done in the 1980s, as if they were baseball card cards.
Very ahead of their time.  This brings me to my last project.
I'm in the middle of two projects, one is called photographers."
This is a six year-old project to do 100 of these human beings.
Each is an archive of our culture, through media and material is engages, dictionaries or magazines.
But each one acts as a kind of file in a way of human being, and they travel in groups of 20, four or 12 at a time.
They're like cells, they come together, they split.
And you can walk between them. I'm taking years.
Each of them is basically a microscope microscope that weighs 1.3 pounds with a human trapped inside.
This has a little cave on the chest.
That's your head -- it's the chest -- you can see the entrance in the country.
I'm going to be accompanied by the rest of the body, there's a waterfall that comes out of the chest, and it covers the penis or not, or whatever it is, a kind of administration thing.
It's a quick round of these works because I can't explain them for a long time.
We have layers, you can see.
This is a body in half.
This has two heads, and it's communicating between the two.
There are some pills that come out and come into the head of this strange statue here.
There is a little forest scene inside of the tourist charity.
Can you see it?
Anyway, this talk is about these boxes, just like the boxes we live in.
We're in a box, the solar system is a box.
This brings me to my last box.
It's a brick box. It's called Pool Words.
Within this box there is a physicist, a neuroscientist, a painter, a musician, a screen, a radio, a radio, a school, a school, an editorial arm that spread all the content we do in the world, and a garden.
We put the box and all of the people from inside each other as particles.
And I think that's the way we change the world.
When you redefine who and the box you're living in.
And together we come to realize that we are all in this together, that this illusion that we're different, these concepts of the countries, from borders, of religion, doesn't work.
We're all very made out of the same matter and in the same box.
And if we don't start trading those things with sweetness and genetically we're going to die very soon.
Thank you very much.
What do you do?
They take an aspiration.
But so that this pill has an effect against pain, first for the stomach, the bowels and other organs.
To take a pill is the most effective system and inducted it so that any drug will be effect in the body.
The deception, though, is that when you bring it any drug to dilute it.
And this is a big problem, especially in HIV patients.
When you take antiretroviral drugs, these serve to decrease the amount of viruses in the blood, and increase the CD cell count.
But they are also known by their side side effects, mostly negative. Because in the time they take to get to the blood car, they disappear, and worse even for the time they take their destiny, which is where it's more important, in the HIV warehouse.
These are regions of the body like the lymph glass, the nervous system, the lungs, where the virus is ingending and it doesn't easily go into the blood of the patients that are attached to regular drug medications.
However, after the treatment of treatment, the virus can wake up and infect new blood cells.
This is the big problem of the treatment of HIV with the current drugs that is a treatment of a life of a long-term life.
One day, I sat down, and I thought, "Could we make the treatment directly to the sport of the virus, without the risk of direction of medicine?
As a scientist in lasers -- the answer was in front of me, the lasers of course.
If you use it in order, for the care of wounds and diabetes and diabetes can be used for anything, including the extracellular transportation of drugs.
In fact, we're already using laser pulses to open or provide extremely small holes, that open and close almost immediately the cells infected with HIV to introduce drugs.
The best you ask yourself, "How is that possible?
We sent a small laser ray on the cellular membrane infected by HIV while these cells are embedded in a liquid that contains drugs.
The laser is carrying the cell, while the cell absorbs drug in question of microbes.
Before we even count, the hole is immediately.
We're currently testing this video technology or in Petri plates, but the goal is to bring this technology to the human body, apply it to the human body.
"How is that possible? You can ask.
Well, the answer is: through a three-digit device.
With the first head, which is our laser, we will make an increase in the infection.
The second head, which is a camera, is headed to the infection site.
Finally, the third head, an injection that distributes the drug, releases it directly on the infection site, while the laser is used again to keep the cells open.
Well, this doesn't seem a lot about time.
But one day, if it's successful, this technology can lead to the total eradication of HIV in the body.
Yeah. A cure for HIV.
This is the dream of all researchers of HIV -- in our case, a laser treatment.
Thank you.
In the last decade, I've been studying to non-state groups -- armed organizations like terrorists.
I document what these groups do when they're not shooting out.
My goal is to understand these genetic agents of violence and study ways to encourage the transition of violent participation.
I do field work, in the world of politics and in the library.
Understanding these groups is key to solving almost every conflict in course, because war has changed.
It used to be a dispute between states.
Not anymore.
It's now a conflict between states and non-governmental actors.
For example, from the 21st peace arrangements signed between 1975 and 2011, '60s were signed between a state and a non-governmental actor.
So we need to understand these groups, we should even engage them or provide them in any process of resolution of successful conflict.
But how do you do that?
We have to know what motivates these organizations.
We know very well the reasons why they fight, how they do, but nobody looks at what they do when they don't fight.
The armed fight and the non-to-one policies are related.
Everything is part of the same organization.
We can't understand these groups, not much less defeat them, without a global vision.
The armed groups of today are complex organizations.
For example, the Herbann Libbas, known by his violent face against Israel.
From their creation in the 1980s, McGowan also established a political party -- a network of social services and a military device.
Similarly, the Halial Palestine, known by their suicide attacks against Israel, also administration the Gaza France since 2007.
So these groups do more than just shooting away.
They're multiverse.
They set up a complex communication machinery, radio stations, TV channels, television websites and strategies in social networks.
And here you have the Italian magazine -- print in English and published to recommend.
The armed groups also invest in a complex fundraising reduction of funding, but by recording businesses, for example, construction companies.
These activities are key.
They allow these groups to increase their strength, increase their funds, to recruit better and build their brand.
Art groups also do something else: create stronger ties with their population investing in social services.
They build schools, they manage hospitals, they put in professional training programs or microphones.
Heck offers all these services and more.
The armed groups are also trying to conquer the population by offering something that the state doesn't provide -- security and protection.
The ascent of the Taliban in an Afghanistan torn by war or even the beginning of the Italian ascent -- you can also understand the efforts of these groups to provide security.
Unfortunately, in these cases, security has an incredibly elevated price for the population.
But generally providing social services means filling a vacuum, a gap left by the government, and allows these groups to strengthen and increase their power.
For example, the election victory of the Allending Hall cannot be understood without recognizing the social work of the group.
It's a really complex scenario, even in the West, when we look at the armed groups, we just think of the violent side.
But that's not enough to understand the strengths of these groups, the strategy or the long-term vision.
These groups are hybrid hydronics.
They grow up because they fill gaps left by the government, and they emerge as armed groups and political groups, participating in violent struggle and giving governance.
And the more complex and sophisticated these organizations, the less we can call them something contrary to a state.
How do you call a group like HeFla?
They mastered part of a territory, they manage all their functions -- they collect the trash, they manage the sewer system.
Is it a state? Is it a rebel group?
Or maybe it's another thing, something new and different.
And what is ICENE?
The lines are devoted.
We live in a world of states, and without state and hydrogen, and the more weak the states, like in the Middle East, the more they intervene and fill that gap, the non-governmental actors.
This is important for governments, because to counter these groups will have to invest more in military tools.
To fill that government gap has to be at the center of any sustainable approach.
This is very important to establish and cost peace.
If we understand the armed groups, we understand better what incentives to offer to promote the transition of violence to violence.
In this new dispute between states and non-state actors, military power can win some battle, but we won't give peace or stability.
To achieve these targets, we need long-term investments to fill that security vacuum to fill that gap of government that allowed these groups to thrive at a beginning.
Thank you.
I'm a failure as a woman and as a feminist.
My opinions about gender equality are very very non-standing, but I fear that accepting the membrane tag would be unfair for feminists.
I'm a feminist, but pretty bad.
And so I got a bad feminist for me.
Or, at least I wrote an article and a book called "The Bad Feminist: and then in the interviews, people started calling me the Malawi Mammal.
So what started as a personal joke dedicated to myself and a deliberate protection, has become a bit bigger.
Let me take a step back.
When I was a young man, especially in my youth, and at the age of 20, I had strange ideas about feminists, these furry women, angry women with men and they hated sex -- as if that was a bad thing.
Today, I see how women are treated around the world and anger, in particular, looks like a perfectly reasonable response.
But at the time, I was worried about the tone that I was using the people when I was going to be a feminist.
Being tagged as a feminist was a concern, a word and a disappeared word.
They took me as a woman who doesn't follow the rules, that he asks too much, with high self-esteem and dare to believe that it's equal or superior to a man.
Nobody wants to be that revolutionary woman, until he realizes that it's actually that woman and can't imagine being another person.
Over time, as I was growing up, I started to accept that I am, in fact, female and also, proud to be.
For me, certain claims are remarkable: women are equal to men.
We deserve the same paycheck by the same work.
We have right to travel around the world as we want it, or whether we want it, free or violence.
We have right to use easily and accessible the contraceptives and reproductive services.
We have the right to decide about our bodies, no need for legislative control or evolutionary doctors.
We have the right to respect.
There is more.
When you talk about the needs of women, you need to be aware of our other identity.
We're not just women.
We are people with a different body, expression of gender, religion and sexuality condition, social conditions, skills and so much.
We need to be aware of these differences and how they affect us, in the same way it matters what we have in common.
Without this kind of inclusion, our feminism is nothing.
For me, these truths are evidence, but to be clear, I'm a disaster.
I'm full of contradictions.
There are a lot of things that make me a bad female.
I have another conference.
When I drive to work, I hear rap music painting all volume.
Although the letter of women and I was deeply offended by the classic "Spot Shaker: The Ying Angel Twitter is incredible.
"I really make it really with your mother show.
He would die, you know, he moves until you hurt the coal."
Think about it.
Pure poetry, right?
I'm completely driven by my musical taste.
I firmly believe in the work of man, which is all I don't want to do, including --  -- all the domestic tasks -- but also killing insects, the baseball card, the carbon care and the maintenance of male.
I don't want to have anything to do with that.
The pink is my favorite color.
I enjoy fashion magazines and beautiful things.
I can see "The Kachelle's and the Romantic Commandments, and I have a lot of amazing stories of the stories that are made true.
Some of my favorites are more disappeared.
If a woman wants to adopt his husband, it's his choice, and I'm not who to judge me.
If a woman decides to stay home to raise his children, I accept that choice, too.
The problem is not that it becomes economically vulnerable through this same choice, the problem is that our society is confidented so that it makes women economically vulnerable when they choose to.
Let's solve this problem.
I reject conventional feminism that has ignored or distinguished historically the needs of color women, workers and homes and transgendered -- to favor white women, heterosexual and middle class class.
Listen, if that's good feminist -- I'm a very bad female.
It also happens the following: as a feminist. I feel a lot of pressure.
We have this tendency to put female feminists on a pedestria.
We hope that they drop out of perfection.
When you get done, we would take them with a lot of taste.
As I said, I'm a disaster, I already consider me from that stone before you try to put me there.
Too many women, particularly innovators and the leaders of the sector, are afraid to be labeled as feminists.
They are afraid to stand up and say, "Yes, I'm a feminist for fear of what that sticker means -- by fear of not being able to be able to be able to get the expectations of the restaurant.
Let's take Beijing, or as I call it, the God.
In the last few years it's a declared feminist female.
In the Video Museum Video 2005, in MRI, in MIT, act in front of the word "female word female word.
It was a magnificent show, looking at this pop star embracing feminism and making women and young men who will be feminist is something to be proud to be.
Over time, cultural critics started debated debates if Beijan was or not exactly feminist.
They rating their feminism instead of just believing the word of an adult and mature woman.
We demand phones, because we're still fighting for a lot, we want a lot of it, we need so much very carefully a lot.
We go far beyond the critical and constructive criticism to design the feminism of any woman, destroy it until there's nothing left.
We don't need to do that.
The bad feminist, or rather, a more inclusive feminist is the point of party.
But what happens next?
We spend our implications of recognizing our importance, going through action and being a little bit more brave.
If I hear multiple music, I'm creating a demand for artists that would be more than happy providing an unlimited supply.
These artists will not change their way to talk about women in their songs until we run the change effectively affecting their profit.
It certainly is hard.
Why does it have its music that will be so paradox?
It's hard to choose something better and so easy to justify a worst choice.
But when bad decisions are justify this makes it more difficult for women to achieve equality, the equality we all deserve and is our responsibility.
I think of my niece, three and four years.
These are two magnificent girls, decide and brilliant -- I want you to grow in a world.
Where you are given to the strong creatures that they are.
I think of them, all of a sudden, the best option is being used as something much easier to do.
We can all make better decisions.
We can change the channel when a television program deals with sexual violence against women as a sport, the Tablate Game.
We can change radio emitter when we hear songs that treat women like anything.
We can spend our money to go to the cinema elsewhere, when movies don't treat women more than a decorative object.
We can stop supporting professional sports where athletes treat their classmates as bus drought.
In any case, the men, especially the white men, heterosexual men can say, "No, I'm not going to publish in your magazine, participate in your project, or work with you, until it doesn't include a enough number of women, both to participate how to make decisions.
I'm not going to work with you until your publication or your organization is more inclusive with a wider range of people."
Those of us who are supposed but invited to participate in these kinds of projects, we can also be able to be included until more like us are welcome to overcome the barriers to the decision positions.
Because we're not the people who are people, without these efforts, without adopting these positions.
We can make these little acts of courage and hope that our decisions come to the top, the people in the direct power and producers of movie and music, CEOs, the legislators -- the people that can make big decisions, more courageous, to create a durable and meaningful change.
We can also be able to claim our feminism vaccine, well, bad, or anything continuing.
The last line of my book "Mala Female: says, "I prefer to be a bad feminist to not be at all."
This is true because of a lot of reasons, but I say that, especially because I got my voice anti-sharing, and the feminism helped me check it.
There was an incident.
I call it incident to address what happened.
A few kids gave me when I was very young, and I didn't know that kids can do this to a girl.
They treated me like nothing.
I started to believe that it wasn't anything.
They stole my voice, and then I didn't dare to believe that I could tell you something that could matter.
But I was writing.
And I went back to writing.
I got a stronger version of myself.
I read the words of those women who could understand a story like mine, and the women who looked like me and understand what it meant to live in this world if you have the brown skin.
I read the words of women who showed me that it wasn't anything.
I learned to write like them, and then I learned to write like myself.
I found my voice again, and I started to believe that my voice is powerful beyond what you can measure.
Through writing and feminism, I also found that if I was a little bit, another woman could hear and see me and realize that none of us is the nothing that the world tries to tell us that we are.
In one hand, I have the power to achieve anything.
And in the other, I hold the humble reality that I'm just a woman.
I'm a bad feminist -- I'm a good woman, I'm trying to improve my way to think, what I say and what I do, without leaving everything that makes me human.
I hope we can all do the same.
I hope we can all be a little brave. When you need such a value.
Just after Christmas last year, 132 children in California, they had self-interested Disney or to be exposed to someone who had been there.
The virus then goes through the border with Canada, infected over 100 children in Bang.
One of the tragic things about this outbreak is that the measles that can be fatal for a child with an immune immune system is one of the most easily preventable diseases in the world.
There's an effective vaccine against this for more than half a century ago, but many of the kids involved in the Disney outbreak hadn't been vaccinated because their parents were afraid of something supposedly even worse, the autism.
But a moment, was it not the article that unleashed the politics of autism and destroyed vaccines, declined and marked by being a fragrance led by the British Medical Journalist?
Don't you think most intelligent scientists that vaccines cause autism is a stupid?
I think most of you know, but millions of parents around the world are still afraid that vaccines put in danger to their children of autism.
Why?
Here's why.
This is a graph of the estimates of autism increase in time.
For most of the 20th century, autism was considered a very rare disease.
The few psychologists and pediatrician that I had heard about it create all their professional life without seeing one case.
For decades, prevalence estimates followed only three or four children per 10,000 children.
But then, in the 1990s, the numbers started to shoot out.
Fortune fundraising organizations like autism Spanish refer routinely to autism as an epidemic -- as if I could get into another child in Disneyland.
What's going on?
If it's not vaccines, what is it?
If you ask people at the Center of Disease Control Center what's going on, they tend to be based on phrases as "radiologists of "passenger diagnostic and better design detection to explain these growing figures.
But that kind of language doesn't look at a lot of the fears of a young mother who seeks the face of her two years old, the visual contact.
If diagnostic criteria had to expand, why were they so reduced at the beginning?
Why were the cases of autism so hard to find before the 1990s?
Five years ago, I decided to discover the answers to these questions.
I learned that what happened is that what happened has less than the slow and expensive progress of science than the seductive power of storytelling.
For most of the 20th century, doctors told a story about what autism is and how it was discovered, but that story turned out to be fake, and the consequences of the same are having a devastating impact in global public health.
There was a second more accurate story of autism that had been lost and forgotten in the dark corners of clinical literature.
This second story tells us all about how we get here and where we have to go.
The first story starts with a child psychiatrist -- Leo Kansa, from the hospital Johns Hopkins -- Kana published an article that described 11 young patients who seemed to be able to inhabit private worlds, native people around their own parents.
They could fun for hours waving their hands in front of their faces, but they were present from the panic for trends as when they didn't put their favorite toy in their usual place without knowing them.
On the basis of the patients treated in their clinic, Kana speculated that autism is very rare.
By the 1950s, as a major authority of the world in the subject, declared that he had seen less than 150 true cases of his syndrome, as I collect representations of places as distant as South Africa.
This is actually not surprising, because Kansas criteria for autism diagnosis were very restrictive.
For example, I was supposed to give that diagnosis to children with conventions, but now we know that epilepsy, it's very common in autism.
He once played that he had turned to nine out of every 10 children sent by other doctors to his consultant for being autistic without giving them a diagnosis of autism.
Kando was an intelligent man, but part of his theories were not certain.
I classified autism as a form of child psychologists caused by cold and distinguished parents.
These kids, he said, have been carefully kept in a refrigerator.
At the same time, though, Kanbaque noticed that some of their young patients had special skills that are added in certain areas like music, mathematics and memory.
One of the kids in their clinic could distinguish between 18 symphonies, before they were two years.
When his mother put one of his favorite records, he correctly said, "Beespance."
But Kansa had a bad opinion of these skills, by adding things like children were simply regurgitating what they had heard their parents, desperate to win their approval parents.
As a result, autism became a source of shame for families, and two generations of autistic children were sent to institutions for their own good, becoming invisible to the world in general.
Amazingly, it wasn't until the 1970s, the researchers started testing the Kana theory that autism was weird.
Long Window, cognitive psychologist in London, I thought the theory of the marriage mothers of Kando was pretty stupid.
She and his husband John were warm and affectionate people, and they had a profound autistic daughter called Susant.
Lord and John knew how hard it was to raise a girl like Susan without support services, no special education, and no access to other resources without a diagnosis.
To defend to the National National Service, that they needed more resources for autistic children and their families, Lord and his colleague Judith Google decided to do something that should have been 30 years before.
They did an autism prevention study in the general population.
They had a submit of London called Changera to try to find autistic kids in the community.
What you saw left left that the Kando model was too limited, because the reality of autism was much more colorful and diverse.
Some children couldn't talk at all, whereas others were focused on their fascination for astrophysics, in dinosaurs or in the generosity of it.
Otherwise, these kids didn't fit in nice frames and savings -- as Japanese, and they saw a lot of them, much more than the Kola model of Kansa would have predicted.
At first, they were lost by trying to make sense of their data.
How did no one have been perceived from these kids before?
But then Lord found a reference to an article that was published in German in 1944, the next year to the Kana article, and that then I forgot it, buried under the ashes of a terrible time that nobody wanted to remember.
Kanzi knew about this article of competition, but he avoided spontaneously to mention it in his own work.
There was no translation to English, but luckily, the Haran husband talked German, and he translated it for her.
The document offers an alternative story of autism.
His author was a man named Hans Asperger, who runs an integrated clinic.
The ideas of Asperger's for children with learning differences were progressive even for contemporary standards.
The morning in their clinic, they started with the kinds of exercises with music, and children follow their games at the afternoon.
Instead of blaming the parents to cause autism, Asperger described it as a political disability of life that require compassionate forms of support and spaces in the course of the entire life.
Instead of treating kids in their clinic as patients as patients called their little teachers, and he was dedicated to help in the development of education methods that were especially suitable for them.
And fundamentally, Spring saw autism as a diverse continuum that took an amazing variety of condoms and disability.
He believed that autism and autistic traits were common and they've always been, looking at aspects of this continuum in architects known in pop culture as the awkward social scientist and the distributed teacher.
He was beyond even to say, that for success in science and art, a piece of autism is essential.
Lord and Judith discovered that Kana was wrong in which autism was invented, as well as the parents were the causes.
In the next few years, they worked with the American Association of psychiatry to extend the diagnostics of the diagnosis that reflect the diversity of what they called anti-complete "species."
At the end of the '80s and early '90s, their changes came into victim, suggesting the limited model of Kanzi by a wide and inclusive and inclusive model.
These changes didn't fall in a broken decline.
Of course, when Lord and Judith worked between the base to reform these criteria -- people around the world see an autistic adult for the first time.
Before Rando Man was in 1988, just a little circle, encouraged by experts knew what the autism was, but after the unusual performance of Dutch Housenal like Rachel Babbage and the recognition of Rai Man with four awards of the Academy. Papers, psychologists, teachers and fathers around the world knew what autism.
At the same time, they introduced the first easy clinical trials to use to diagnose autism.
I shouldn't have a connection with that little circle of experts to achieve a diagnosis for his son.
The combination of Rain Man: The changes in the criteria and the introduction of these tests created a network, a perfect storm of autism awareness.
The number of diagnostics began to rise up, like they predicted Lord and Judie, in fact they hoped that it was, getting people with autism and their families finally got the support and services that they deserve.
So Andrew Wallerants came to blame vaccines for increase in diagnosis -- a simple, powerful, sensitive history as bad as Kansa theory that autism was invented.
If the current estimate of the prevention center that one in 68 children in the United States are in the spectrum, it's right, the autistic are one of the largest minority groups in the world.
In the last few years, autistic people have come together on the Internet to reject the idea that they are the puzzles to solve for the new medical advances by giving the term neuroscience to celebrate the varieties of human cognition.
One way to understand neuroscience is to think about terms of human operating systems.
The fact that a PC doesn't work with Windows doesn't mean it's broken.
According to autistic standards, the normal human brain is easily distributed, obsessed by social, and it suffers from an attention deficit to detail.
Indeed, autistic people have difficulty to live in a world didn't build for them.
70 years later, we're still reaching Spring, who believed that the cure for the most income aspects of autism are in understanding the teachers, employees with ability, support communities, and parents with faith in the potential of their children.
An autistic woman named Bish Zaches once said, "We need all the hands in covered to deliver the boat of humanity.
As we navigate to an uncertain future, we need all the forms of human intelligence on the planet to address the challenges that we face as a society.
We can't afford to waste or a brain.
Thank you.
